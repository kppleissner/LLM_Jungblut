"1","Histone H3 clipping is a novel signature of human neutrophil extracellular traps.","Tilley, Abuabed, Zimny Arndt, Schmid, Florian, Jungblut, Brinkmann, Herzig, Zychlinsky","2022","Neutrophils are critical to host defence, executing diverse strategies to perform their antimicrobial and regulatory functions. One tactic is the production of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs). In response to certain stimuli, neutrophils decondense their lobulated nucleus and release chromatin into the extracellular space through a process called NETosis. However, NETosis, and the subsequent degradation of NETs, can become dysregulated. NETs are proposed to play a role in infectious as well as many non-infection related diseases including cancer, thrombosis, autoimmunity and neurological disease. Consequently, there is a need to develop specific tools for the study of these structures in disease contexts. In this study, we identified a NET-specific histone H3 cleavage event and harnessed this to develop a cleavage site-specific antibody for the detection of human NETs. By microscopy, this antibody distinguishes NETs from chromatin in purified and mixed cell samples. It also detects NETs in tissue sections. We propose this antibody as a new tool to detect and quantify NETs."
"2","The comparison between 2DE-MS and bottom-up LC-MS demands high-end techniques for both technologies.","Zhan, Jungblut","2022","In contrast to bottom-up LC-MS only 2DE-MS can separate and detect a huge number of human protein species. Kwiatkowski et al. (in this issue) established parameters to estimate the amount of protein speciation for each human protein. Proteins identified in 2DE-MS approaches showed more protein speciation than in bottom-up LC-MS. The authors state that protein speciation is likely to increase the chance of proteins to be determined in 2-DE/MS, though admitting that low-sensitivity 2DE-MS methods were used in this study. In agreement with Kwiatkowski et al., we are convinced that the difference between 2DE-MS and bottom-up LC-MS will disappear, if high-resolution 2DE is combined with identification by a high-sensitivity LC-Orbitrap-MS. Meta-analysis of proteomic data is surely a promising tool, though the technological progress in 2DE and MS has to reach a plateau to enable useful comparisons."
"3","Innovating the Concept and Practice of Two-Dimensional Gel Electrophoresis in the Analysis of Proteomes at the Proteoform Level.","Zhan, Li, Zhan, Schlüter, Jungblut, Coorssen","2019","Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2DE) is an important and well-established technical platform enabling extensive top-down proteomic analysis. However, the long-held but now largely outdated conventional concepts of 2DE have clearly impacted its application to in-depth investigations of proteomes at the level of protein species/proteoforms. It is time to popularize a new concept of 2DE for proteomics. With the development and enrichment of the proteome concept, any given ""protein"" is now recognized to consist of a series of proteoforms. Thus, it is the proteoform, rather than the canonical protein, that is the basic unit of a proteome, and each proteoform has a specific isoelectric point (pI) and relative mass (Mr ). Accordingly, using 2DE, each proteoform can routinely be resolved and arrayed according to its different pI and Mr . Each detectable spot contains multiple proteoforms derived from the same gene, as well as from different genes. Proteoforms derived from the same gene are distributed into different spots in a 2DE pattern. High-resolution 2DE is thus actually an initial level of separation to address proteome complexity and is effectively a pre-fractionation method prior to analysis using mass spectrometry (MS). Furthermore, stable isotope-labeled 2DE coupled with high-sensitivity liquid chromatography-tandem MS (LC-MS/MS) has tremendous potential for the large-scale detection, identification, and quantification of the proteoforms that constitute proteomes."

Cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS) is a cytosolic DNA sensor that activates innate immunity by initiating the STING-IRF3-type I IFN signalling cascade1,2. Recognition of ruptured micronuclei by cGAS links genome instability to the innate immune response3,4, but the potential involvement of cGAS in DNA repair remains unknown. Here we demonstrate that cGAS inhibits homologous recombination in mouse and human models. DNA damage induces nuclear translocation of cGAS in a manner that is dependent on importin-α, and the phosphorylation of cGAS at tyrosine 215-mediated by B-lymphoid tyrosine kinase-facilitates the cytosolic retention of cGAS. In the nucleus, cGAS is recruited to double-stranded breaks and interacts with PARP1 via poly(ADP-ribose). The cGAS-PARP1 interaction impedes the formation of the PARP1-Timeless complex, and thereby suppresses homologous recombination. We show that knockdown of cGAS suppresses DNA damage and inhibits tumour growth both in vitro and in vivo. We conclude that nuclear cGAS suppresses homologous-recombination-mediated repair and promotes tumour growth, and that cGAS therefore represents a potential target for cancer prevention and therapy."
"5","Small heat shock protein speciation: novel non-canonical 44 kDa HspB5-related protein species in rat and human tissues.","Benndorf, Gilmont, Hirano, Ransom, Jungblut, Bommer, Goldman, Welsh","2018","When analyzing small stress proteins of rat and human tissues by electrophoretic methods followed by western blotting, and using the anti-HspB1/anti-HspB5 antibody clone 8A7, we unexpectedly found a protein with a molecular mass of ~44 kDa. On two-dimensional gels, this protein resolved into four distinct species. Electrophoretic and immunological evidence suggests that this 44 kDa protein is a derivative of HspB5, most likely a covalently linked HspB5 dimer. This HspB5-like 44 kDa protein (HspB5L-P44) is particularly abundant in rat heart, brain, and renal cortex and glomeruli. HspB5L-P44 was also found in human brains, including those from patients with Alexander disease, a condition distinguished by cerebral accumulation of HspB5. Gray matter of such a patient contained an elevated amount of HspB5L-P44. A spatial model of structurally ordered dimeric HspB5 α-crystallin domains reveals the exposed and adjacent position of the two peptide segments homologous to the HspB1-derived 8A7 antigen determinant peptide (epitope). This explains the observed extraordinary high avidity of the 8A7 antibody towards HspB5L-P44, as opposed to commonly used HspB5-specific antibodies which recognize other epitopes. This scenario also explains the remarkable fact that no previous study reported the existence of HspB5L-P44 species. Exposure of rat endothelial cells to UV light, an oxidative stress condition, temporarily increased HspB5L-P44, suggesting physiological regulation of the dimerization. The existence of HspB5L-P44 supports the protein speciation discourse and fits to the concept of the protein code, according to which the expression of a given gene is reflected only by the complete set of the derived protein species."
"6","Sex differences in murine myocardium are not exclusively regulated by gonadal hormones.","Theuring, Neumann, Scheler, Jungblut, Schwab","2018","We investigated sex differences in cardiac protein patterns of intact and castrated mice using proteomics and 1D and 2D immunoblotting. To exclude differences concerning developmental aspects gonadectomy was conducted in mature mice at the age of three months. The main sex-related regulation in the protein pattern of the myocardium occurred for proteins involved in metabolic processes whereas only few proteins involved in other pathways underwent a regulation. Many regulated proteins (2/3) displayed a characteristic V form, which means that these proteins are up- or down-regulated in sexually mature compared to young mice and are back-regulated after castration, emphasizing a direct regulation by gonadal hormones. Several other spots (1/3) showed the same male/female regulation or a drastic increase in male/female spot intensity ratio after castration, suggesting either a regulation independent of sex hormones or a removal of an inhibiting feedback mechanism by gonadectomy. Technically, we found that it cannot be expected that a single spot contains only one protein species and that one protein is present in only one spot. We thus propose for proteomic investigations to identify/quantify all spots of a 2-DE pattern to obtain information about protein speciation and its potential importance for function and pathology."
"7","How many proteins can be identified in a 2DE gel spot within an analysis of a complex human cancer tissue proteome?","Zhan, Yang, Peng, Li, Mu, Long, Cheng, Huang, Li, Lu, Li, Li, Liu, Jungblut","2018","Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2DE) in proteomics is traditionally assumed to contain only one or two proteins in each 2DE spot. However, 2DE resolution is being complemented by the rapid development of high sensitivity mass spectrometers. Here we compared MALDI-MS, LC-Q-TOF MS and LC-Orbitrap Velos MS for the identification of proteins within one spot. With LC-Orbitrap Velos MS each Coomassie Blue-stained 2DE spot contained an average of at least 42 and 63 proteins/spot in an analysis of a human glioblastoma proteome and a human pituitary adenoma proteome, respectively, if a single gel spot was analyzed. If a pool of three matched gel spots was analyzed this number further increased up to an average of 230 and 118 proteins/spot for glioblastoma and pituitary adenoma proteome, respectively. Multiple proteins per spot confirm the necessity of isotopic labeling in large-scale quantification of different protein species in a proteome. Furthermore, a protein abundance analysis revealed that most of the identified proteins in each analyzed 2DE spot were low-abundance proteins. Many proteins were present in several of the analyzed spots showing the ability of 2DE-MS to separate at the protein species level. Therefore, 2DE coupled with high-sensitivity LC-MS has a clearly higher sensitivity as expected until now to detect, identify and quantify low abundance proteins in a complex human proteome with an estimated resolution of about 500 000 protein species. This clearly exceeds the resolution power of bottom-up LC-MS investigations."

"9","Analysis of T4SS-induced signaling by H. pylori using quantitative phosphoproteomics.","Glowinski, Holland, Thiede, Jungblut, Meyer","2014","Helicobacter pylori is a Gram-negative bacterial pathogen colonizing the human stomach. Infection with H. pylori causes chronic inflammation of the gastric mucosa and may lead to peptic ulceration and/or gastric cancer. A major virulence determinant of H. pylori is the type IV secretion system (T4SS), which is used to inject the virulence factor CagA into the host cell, triggering a wide range of cellular signaling events. Here, we used a phosphoproteomic approach to investigate tyrosine signaling in response to host-pathogen interaction, using stable isotope labeling in cell culture (SILAC) of AGS cells to obtain a differential picture between multiple infection conditions. Cells were infected with wild type H. pylori P12, a P12Δ CagA deletion mutant, and a P12Δ PAI deletion mutant to compare signaling changes over time and in the absence of CagA or the T4SS. Tryptic peptides were enriched for tyrosine (Tyr) phosphopeptides and analyzed by nano-LC-Orbitrap MS. In total, 85 different phosphosites were found to be regulated following infection. The majority of phosphosites identified were kinases of the MAPK family. CagA and the T4SS were found to be key regulators of Tyr phosphosites. Our findings indicate that CagA primarily induces activation of ERK1 and integrin-linked factors, whereas the T4SS primarily modulates JNK and p38 activation."
"10","The proteomics quantification dilemma.","Jungblut","2014","Proteomics is dominated today by the protein expression discourse, which favorites the bottom-up approach because of its high throughput and its high sensitivity. For quantification this proceeding is misleading, if a protein is present with more than one protein species in the sample to be analyzed. The protein speciation discourse considers this more realistic situation and affords the top-down procedures or at least a separation of the protein species in advance to identification and quantification. Today all of the top-down procedures are one order of magnitude less sensitive than the bottom-up ones. To increase sensitivity and to increase throughput are major challenges for proteomics of the next years. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: 20years of Proteomics in memory of Viatliano Pallini. Guest Editors: Luca Bini, Juan J. Calvete, Natacha Turck, Denis Hochstrasser and Jean-Charles Sanchez."
"11","Back to the future--the value of single protein species investigations.","Jungblut","2013","In proteomics, in the past years, there was a focus on high throughput and reaching of large numbers of identified proteins with the basic discourse of protein expression. To avoid the impression of producing pure lists attempts are usually made to correlate proteins changed in amount between two biological situations to different pathways or protein interactions. This discourse is based on two simplifications, which limit the applicability of proteomics drastically: (i) it is sufficient to quantify a protein from several enzymatic digestion products; (ii) a biological situation is sufficiently described, if a peptide with its PTM is identified, resulting in long lists of modified peptides with data amounts, which are not anymore made accessible for the reader of a publication. The elucidation of N-terminal methylation of proteasome subunit Rpt1 in yeast by Kimura et al. (Proteomics 2013, 13, 3167-3174), which represents the focus on one protein, shows the value of solid chemical analysis with a complete data documentation and paves the way to proteomics based on the protein speciation discourse."
"12","Analysis of protein species differentiation among mycobacterial low-Mr-secreted proteins by narrow pH range Immobiline gel 2-DE-MALDI-MS.","Lange, Rosenkrands, Stein, Andersen, Kaufmann, Jungblut","2014","Secreted proteins of bacteria are preferentially capable of interacting with host cells and are therefore of special biological and medical interest. Narrow pH range 2-DE and MALDI-TOFTOF-MS combine high-resolution protein separation with highly sensitive identification of proteins. Secreted proteins of Mycobacterium tuberculosis were separated at the protein species level, distinguishing different protein species of one protein. We focused on the pI range 4.0-4.7 and the Mr range 6-20kDa of the 2-DE pattern. Out of 128 analyzed spots, 121 were identified resulting in 33 different proteins with 277 different protein species, accumulating in a mean of 8.4 protein species per protein. Overrepresentation was found for the protein classes ""virulence, detoxification, adaption"", ""information pathways"", ""cell wall and cell processes"" and ""intermediary metabolism and respiration"". Thus far, 15 protein species of the ESX-1 family are characterized with 100% sequence coverage. More automated 2-DE procedures and more sensitive identification techniques are required for complete characterization of all of the protein species even in highly enriched samples, such as culture filtrates. Only then the functional level of proteomics will be achieved and potential biomarkers can be postulated at the molecular level."
"13","Dynein light chain 8a of Toxoplasma gondii, a unique conoid-localized β-strand-swapped homodimer, is required for an efficient parasite growth.","Qureshi, Hofmann, Arroyo-Olarte, Nickl, Hoehne, Jungblut, Lucius, Scheerer, Gupta","2013","Dynein light chain 8 (DLC8) is a ubiquitous eukaryotic protein regulating diverse cellular functions. We show that the obligate intracellular parasite Toxoplasma gondii harbors 4 DLC8 proteins (TgDLC8a-d), of which only TgDLC8a clusters in the mainstream LC8 class. TgDLC8b-d proteins form a divergent and alveolate-specific clade. TgDLC8b-d proteins are largely cytosolic, whereas TgDLC8a resides in the conoid at the apical end of T. gondii. The apical location of TgDLC8a is also not shared by its nearly identical Eimeria (EtDLC8a), Plasmodium (PfDLC8), or human (HsDLC8) orthologs. Notwithstanding an exclusive conoid targeting, TgDLC8a exhibits a classical LC8 structure. It forms a homodimer by swapping of the β strands that interact with the antiparallel β' strands of the opposing monomers. The TgDLC8a dimer contains two identical binding grooves and appears to be adapted for multitarget recognition. By contrast, the previously reported PfDLC8 homodimer is shaped by binding of the β strand with the parallel β' strand and lacks such a distinct binding interface. Our comparisons suggest an unexpected structural and functional divergence of the two otherwise conserved proteins from apicomplexan parasites. Finally, we demonstrate that a phosphomimetic S88E mutation renders the TgDLC8a-S88E mutant monomeric and cytosolic in T. gondii, and its overexpression inhibits the parasite growth in human fibroblasts."
"14","High resolution quantitative proteomics of HeLa cells protein species using stable isotope labeling with amino acids in cell culture(SILAC), two-dimensional gel electrophoresis(2DE) and nano-liquid chromatograpohy coupled to an LTQ-OrbitrapMass spectrometer.","Thiede, Koehler, Strozynski, Treumann, Stein, Zimny-Arndt, Schmid, Jungblut","2013","The proteomics field has shifted over recent years from two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE)-based approaches to SDS-PAGE or gel-free workflows because of the tremendous developments in isotopic labeling techniques, nano-liquid chromatography, and high-resolution mass spectrometry. However, 2-DE still offers the highest resolution in protein separation. Therefore, we combined stable isotope labeling with amino acids in cell culture of controls and apoptotic HeLa cells with 2-DE and the subsequent analysis of tryptic peptides via nano-liquid chromatography coupled to an LTQ-Orbitrap mass spectrometer to obtain quantitative data using the methods with the highest resolving power on all levels of the proteomics workflow. More than 1,200 proteins with more than 2,700 protein species were identified and quantified from 816 Coomassie Brilliant Blue G-250 stained 2-DE spots. About half of the proteins were identified and quantified only in single 2-DE spots. The majority of spots revealed one to five proteins; however, in one 2-DE spot, up to 23 proteins were identified. Only half of the 2-DE spots represented a dominant protein with more than 90% of the whole protein amount. Consequently, quantification based on staining intensities in 2-DE gels would in approximately half of the spots be imprecise, and minor components could not be quantified. These problems are circumvented by quantification using stable isotope labeling with amino acids in cell culture. Despite challenges, as shown in detail for lamin A/C and vimentin, the quantitative changes of protein species can be detected. The combination of 2-DE with high-resolution nano-liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry allowed us to identify proteomic changes in apoptotic cells that would be unobservable using any of the other previously employed proteomic workflows."

We tested whether immunoproteasome protein-containing subpopulations are present in the alveolar space of patients with lung inflammation evoking the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) supernatants and cell pellet lysate from ARDS patients (n = 28) and healthy subjects (n = 10) were analyzed for the presence of immunoproteasome proteins (LMP2 and LMP7) and proteasome subtypes by western blot, chromatographic purification, and 2D-dimensional gelelectrophoresis. In all ARDS patients but not in healthy subjects LMP7 and LMP2 were observed in BAL supernatants. Proteasomes purified from pooled ARDS BAL supernatant showed an altered enzyme activity ratio. Chromatography revealed a distinct pattern with 7 proteasome subtype peaks in BAL supernatant of ARDS patients that differed from healthy subjects. Total proteasome concentration in BAL supernatant was increased in ARDS (971 ng/mL ± 1116 versus 59 ± 25; P < 0.001), and all fluorogenic substrates were hydrolyzed, albeit to a lesser extent, with inhibition by epoxomicin (P = 0.0001). Thus, we identified for the first time immunoproteasome proteins and a distinct proteasomal subtype pattern in the alveolar space of ARDS patients, presumably in response to inflammation."
"17","Dietary phytoestrogen supplementation induces sex differences in the myocardial protein pattern of mice: a comparative proteomics study.","Schwab, Neumann, Vignon-Zellweger, Fischer, Stein, Jungblut, Scheler, Theuring","2011","Elevated cardiovascular risk in postmenopausal women and beneficial actions of estrogen replacement in animal models have been related to protective effects of estrogens. However, randomized trials of hormone replacement therapy with synthetic estrogens in humans failed confirmation and phytoestrogens, natural plant hormones with agonistic properties for estrogen receptors, could represent potential alternatives. The aim of the present study is to characterize an animal model for alternative hormone replacement with genistein as a natural estrogenic compound. We performed a 2-DE/ESI-LC-MS approach in order to identify protein species varying with genistein receipt and sex in their relative abundance in the healthy murine heart (http://www.mpiib-berlin.mpg.de/2D-PAGE). Oral genistein treatment revealed a substantial effect on the relative abundance of both estrogen receptors. Several enzymes of the fatty acid metabolism and their transcriptional regulators varied differentially in male and in female animals, at the transcript and/or the protein species level. Increased levels of enzyme species involved in the oxidative phosphorylation and generation of ROS were accompanied by decreased amounts of antioxidants in male mice receiving genistein compared with control males, which have been previously associated with various pathological conditions. Exposure of female animals to genistein provoked an increased abundance of two species of LIM domain-binding protein and one species of desmin. These proteins have been associated with cardiac hypertrophy and our data warrant caution for the use of them as molecular markers, since the animals did not exhibit any histological signs of cardiac hypertrophy."
"18","Quantitative phosphoproteomics reveals link between Helicobacter pylori infection and RNA splicing modulation in host cells.","Holland, Schmid, Zimny-Arndt, Rohloff, Stein, Jungblut, Meyer","2011","The Gram-negative, spiral-shaped bacterium Helicobacter pylori is a common human pathogen that causes chronic inflammation of the human gastric mucosa, leading to peptic ulceration and/or gastric cancer. Here, we analyzed changes in the phosphoproteome of gastric epithelial cells (AGS) upon infection with H. pylori using a combination of SILAC, phosphoprotein enrichment, 2-DE, and MALDI TOF/TOF-MS. From a total of 526 spots we identified 391 protein species (143 proteins) and quantified 332 (127 proteins). Nearly, one-third of the identified proteins (40/143) were associated with the spliceosome or RNA splicing. The abundance of 20 proteins was altered by H. pylori infection, in particular, a number of serine arginine-rich (SR) proteins involved in the regulation and control of alternative splicing. Importantly, the combined methodologies enabled the detection of infection-dependent protein species-specific regulation, suggesting functional modulation of individual protein species. These findings reveal unexpected new insights into the mechanisms of host cell manipulation by H. pylori, which are likely associated with gastric pathologies, including gastric cancer."

As membrane proteins function in complexes, methods to detect and to characterize membrane protein-protein interactions are undoubtedly required. Therefore, we developed the ""Membrane-Strep-tagged protein interaction experiment"" (Membrane-SPINE) that combines the specific purification of a Strep-tagged membrane protein with the reversible fixation of protein complexes by formaldehyde cross-linking. In combination with MS analysis, we suggest Membrane-SPINE as a powerful tool to identify unknown interaction partners of membrane proteins in vivo."
"21","Towards the analysis of protein species: an overview about strategies and methods.","Jungblut, Schlüter","2011","The deciphering of the relationship between function and exact chemical composition of a defined protein species in the context of the proteome is one of the major challenges in proteomics and molecular cell physiology. In the Special Issue of Amino Acids about the analysis of protein species current approaches are reviewed and new methods described focusing on the investigation of protein species. On the basis of the articles in this Special Issue it can be summarized that first important and promising steps towards the comprehensive analysis of protein species have been done. It is already possible to obtain full (100%) sequence coverage of proteins by mass spectrometry, if the amount of proteins available for their analysis allows their proteolytic degradation by more than one protease and the subsequent mass spectrometric analysis of the resulting peptides. Employing affinity chromatography helps to analyse proteins with defined post-translational modifications thus opening a targeted view on e.g. the phosphoproteome. In the future the aim to identify the exact chemical composition including not one but every posttranslational modification and complete sequence coverage on the protein species level should be achievable with further progress in sample preparation techniques, especially concerning separation techniques on the protein level, mass spectrometry and algorithms for mass spectrometric data processing. For determining the function of defined protein species a closer cooperation between cell biologists and proteomics experts is desirable."
"22","Helicobacter pylori HP0518 affects flagellin glycosylation to alter bacterial motility.","Asakura, Churin, Bauer, Boettcher, Bartfeld, Hashii, Kawasaki, Mollenkopf, Jungblut, Brinkmann, Meyer","2010","Helicobacter pylori is a human gastric pathogen associated with gastric and duodenal ulcers as well as gastric cancer. Mounting evidence suggests this pathogen's motility is prerequisite for successful colonization of human gastric tissues. Here, we isolated an H. pylori G27 HP0518 mutant exhibiting altered motility in comparison to its parental strain. We show that the mutant's modulated motility is linked to increased levels of O-linked glycosylation on flagellin A (FlaA) protein. Recombinant HP0518 protein decreased glycosylation levels of H. pylori flagellin in vitro, indicating that HP0518 functions in deglycosylation of FlaA protein. Furthermore, mass spectrometric analysis revealed increased glycosylation of HP0518 FlaA was due to a change in pseudaminic acid (Pse) levels on FlaA; HP0518 mutant-derived flagellin contained approximately threefold more Pse than the parental strain. Further phenotypic and molecular characterization demonstrated that the hyper-motile HP0518 mutant exhibits superior colonization capabilities and subsequently triggers enhanced CagA phosphorylation and NF-κB activation in AGS cells. Our study shows that HP0518 is involved in the deglycosylation of flagellin, thereby regulating pathogen motility. These findings corroborate the prominent function of H. pylori flagella in pathogen-host cell interactions and modulation of host cell responses, likely influencing the pathogenesis process."
"23","Influence of RET/PTC1 and RET/PTC3 oncoproteins in radiation-induced papillary thyroid carcinomas on amounts of cytoskeletal protein species.","Zeindl-Eberhart, Liebmann, Jungblut, Mattow, Schmid, Kerler, Rabes","2011","Radiation-induced human papillary thyroid carcinomas (PTCs) show a high prevalence of fusions of the RET proto-oncogene to heterologous genes H4 (RET/PTC1) and ELE1 (RET/PTC3), respectively. In contrast to the normal membrane-bound RET protein, aberrant RET fusion proteins are constitutively active oncogenic cytosolic proteins that can lead to malignant transformation of thyroid epithelia. To detect specific tumor-associated protein changes that reflect the effect of RET/PTC fusion proteins, we analyzed normal thyroid tissues, thyroid tumors of the RET/PTC1 and RET/PTC3 type and their respective lymph node metastases by a combination of high-resolution two-dimensional electrophoresis and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-mass spectrometry. PTCs without RET rearrangements served as controls. Several cytoskeletal protein species showed quantitative changes in tumors and lymph node metastases harboring RET/PTC1 or RET/PTC3. We observed prominent C-terminal actin fragments assumedly generated by protease cleavages induced due to enhanced amounts of the active actin-binding protein cofilin-1. In addition, three truncated vimentin species, one of which was proven to be headless, were shown to be highly abundant in tumors and metastases of both RET/PTC types. The observed protein changes are closely connected with the constitutive activation of RET-rearranged oncoproteins and reflect the importance to elucidate disease-related typical signatures on the protein species level."

"25","Adaptation of proteomic techniques for the identification and characterization of protein species from murine heart.","Schwab, Neumann, Scheler, Jungblut, Theuring","2011","Disturbed energy metabolism with impaired fatty acid oxidation, ATP synthesis and changing levels of contractile proteins has been observed during the development and manifestation of cardiovascular diseases, with the latter showing sexual differences in terms of onset, manifestation and progress. Estrogenic compounds, such as estrogens and phytoestrogens, are known to exert beneficial effects on several cardiovascular parameters. However, global studies implying the normal, non-failing myocardium are rare. Thus, identifying and characterizing protein patterns involved in the maintenance of normal heart physiology at the protein species level will help understanding disease conditions. In this study, we performed an adapted 2-DE/MS approach in order to identify and characterize post-translational modified and truncated protein species from murine heart. Female and male animals of different age were receiving the phytoestrogen genistein and comparative analyses were performed to identify sex and genistein treatment-related effects. Selected 2-DE spots that exposed varying abundance between animal groups and identified as identical proteins were subject to multi-protease cleavage to generate an elevated sequence coverage enabling characterization of post-translational modifications and truncation loci via high-resolution MS. Several truncated, phosphorylated and acetylated species were identified for mitochondrial ATP synthase, malate dehydrogenase and trifunctional enzyme subunit alpha. However, confirmation of several of these modifications by manual spectra interpretation failed. Thus, our results warrant caution for the blind trust in software output. For the regulatory light chain of myosin, we identified an N-terminal processed species, which so far has been related to ischemic conditions only. We tried to unravel the information content of protein species separated by high-resolution 2-DE as an alternative to high-throughput proteomics, which mainly is interested in lists of protein names, ignoring the protein species identity."
"26","Quantitative proteome analysis of the 20S proteasome of apoptotic Jurkat T cells.","Schmidt, Dahlmann, Hustoft, Koehler, Strozynski, Kloss, Zimny-Arndt, Jungblut, Thiede","2011","Regulated proteolysis plays important roles in cell biology and pathological conditions. A crosstalk exists between apoptosis and the ubiquitin-proteasome system, two pathways responsible for regulated proteolysis executed by different proteases. To investigate whether the apoptotic process also affects the 20S proteasome, we performed three independent SILAC-based quantitative proteome approaches: 1-DE/MALDI-MS, small 2-DE/MALDI-MS and large 2-DE/nano-LC-ESI-MS. Taking the results of all experiments together, no quantitative changes were observed for the α- and β-subunits of the 20S proteasome except for subunit α7. This protein was identified in two protein spots with a down-regulation of the more acidic protein species (α7a) and up-regulation of the more basic protein species (α7b) during apoptosis. The difference in these two α7 protein species could be attributed to oxidation of cysteine-41 to cysteine sulfonic acid and phosphorylation at serine-250 near the C terminus in α7a, whereas these modifications were missing in α7b. These results pointed to the biological significance of posttranslational modifications of proteasome subunit α7 after induction of apoptosis."

For data mining the protein mapping and comparison tool PROMPT (http://webclu.bio.wzw.tum.de/prompt/) was used. The percentage of proteins with transmembrane regions, relative to all proteins detected, was 0, 0.2, 0, 0.5, 3.8 and 6.3% for 2-DE, Supprot, Startline, Sephadex, Pellet, and Etalon, respectively. 2-DE does not separate membrane proteins because they are insoluble in 9 M urea/70 mM DTT and 2% CHAPS. SDS solubilizes a considerable portion of the urea-insoluble proteins and makes them accessible for separation by SDS-PAGE and LC. The 2-DE/MS analysis with urea-solubilized proteins and the 1-DE-LC/MS analysis with the urea-insoluble protein fraction (Pellet) are complementary procedures in the pursuit of a complete proteome analysis. Access to the PROMPT-generated diagrams in the Proteome Database allows the mining of experimental data with respect to other functional aspects."
"28","Neutrophil extracellular traps contain calprotectin, a cytosolic protein complex involved in host defense against Candida albicans.","Urban, Ermert, Schmid, Abu-Abed, Goosmann, Nacken, Brinkmann, Jungblut, Zychlinsky","2009","Neutrophils are the first line of defense at the site of an infection. They encounter and kill microbes intracellularly upon phagocytosis or extracellularly by degranulation of antimicrobial proteins and the release of Neutrophil Extracellular Traps (NETs). NETs were shown to ensnare and kill microbes. However, their complete protein composition and the antimicrobial mechanism are not well understood. Using a proteomic approach, we identified 24 NET-associated proteins. Quantitative analysis of these proteins and high resolution electron microscopy showed that NETs consist of modified nucleosomes and a stringent selection of other proteins. In contrast to previous results, we found several NET proteins that are cytoplasmic in unstimulated neutrophils. We demonstrated that of those proteins, the antimicrobial heterodimer calprotectin is released in NETs as the major antifungal component. Absence of calprotectin in NETs resulted in complete loss of antifungal activity in vitro. Analysis of three different Candida albicans in vivo infection models indicated that NET formation is a hitherto unrecognized route of calprotectin release. By comparing wild-type and calprotectin-deficient animals we found that calprotectin is crucial for the clearance of infection. Taken together, the present investigations confirmed the antifungal activity of calprotectin in vitro and, moreover, demonstrated that it contributes to effective host defense against C. albicans in vivo. We showed for the first time that a proportion of calprotectin is bound to NETs in vitro and in vivo."
"29","Finding one's way in proteomics: a protein species nomenclature.","Schlüter, Apweiler, Holzhütter, Jungblut","2009","Our knowledge of proteins has greatly improved in recent years, driven by new technologies in the fields of molecular biology and proteome research. It has become clear that from a single gene not only one single gene product but many different ones - termed protein species - are generated, all of which may be associated with different functions. Nonetheless, an unambiguous nomenclature for describing individual protein species is still lacking. With the present paper we therefore propose a systematic nomenclature for the comprehensive description of protein species. The protein species nomenclature is flexible and adaptable to every level of knowledge and of experimental data in accordance with the exact chemical composition of individual protein species. As a minimum description the entry name (gene name + species according to the UniProt knowledgebase) can be used, if no analytical data about the target protein species are available."

"32","Classical proteomics: two-dimensional electrophoresis/MALDI mass spectrometry.","Zimny-Arndt, Schmid, Ackermann, Jungblut","2009","The rapid development in proteomics over the last 10 years has led to a series of new technologies and combinations of them designed to unravel as much as possible of the proteins of an organism or otherwise specified biological material. Despite being a little tricky at certain steps, 2-DE has a very high resolution power with more than 10,000 spots per gel and is able to separate one protein into its different protein species caused by posttranslational modifications, alternative splicing or genetic variability. This high-resolution separation is combined with a highly sensitive identification method using peptide mass fingerprinting combined with sequence information by MS/MS, which results in high sequence coverage: the key to elucidate protein species structures. The off-line measurement by MALDI-TOFTOF-MS allows the repeated measurement of each sample and therefore provides more complete structure information for each protein species. The presented protocols represent the basic technology consisting of 2-DE, two staining methods, tryptic digestion and MALDI-TOFTOF-MS."

The differences upon cataractogenesis in the urea soluble proteins of the lens of two mouse strains, C57BL/6J and 129/SvJ, were analyzed by a comparative proteomics approach. Determination of the complete proteome of an organ offers the opportunity to characterize at a molecular level, differences in gene expression and PTMs occurring during pathology and between individuals. The abundance of 63 protein species was altered between the strains. A unique aspect of this study is the identification of chaperonin subunit 6A, mortalin, ERp29, and syntaxin-binding protein 6 in the eye lens. DNA polymorphisms resulting in nonconservative amino acid changes that led to altered physicochemical properties of the proteins were detected for mortalin, chaperonin subunit 6A, annexin A1, and possibly gamma-N crystallin. The results show HSP27/25 and/or ERp29 are the likely major modifying factors for cataractogenesis. Extension of the results suggests that small heat-shock proteins have a major role for influencing cataract formation in humans."

This system may be used to publish two-dimensional electrophoretic proteomics data, and also may be accessed by external users who want to compare their own data with those in the databases. The maintenance of the database is managed centrally. The producers of proteomics data do not need to construct a database themselves. Users can introduce mass spectra into the database, which allows the searching of peptide mass fingerprints against their own protein sequence databases. The first release published in January 2002 contains data from Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Helicobacter pylori, Borrelia garinii, Francisella tularensis, Chlamydia pneumoniae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Jurkat T-cells and mouse mammary gland projects (http://www.mpiib-berlin. mpg.de/2D-PAGE/)."

This has also precluded direct proteome analysis of the intracellular, amastigote form of Leishmania spp., protozoan parasites that cause a spectrum of diseases that affect some 12 million patients worldwide. Here a method is presented that combines classic, isopycnic density centrifugation with fluorescent particle sorting for purification by exploiting transgenic, fluorescent parasites to allow direct proteome analysis of the purified organisms. By this approach the proteome of intracellular Leishmania mexicana amastigotes was compared with that of extracellular promastigotes that are transmitted by insect vectors. In total, 509 different proteins were identified by mass spectrometry and database search. This number corresponds to approximately 6% of gene products predicted from the reference genome of Leishmania major. Intracellular amastigotes synthesized significantly more proteins with basic pI and showed a greater abundance of enzymes of fatty acid catabolism, which may reflect their living in acidic habitats and metabolic adaptation to nutrient availability, respectively. Bioinformatics analyses of the genes corresponding to the protein data sets produced clear evidence for skewed codon usage and translational bias in these organisms. Moreover analysis of the subset of genes whose products were more abundant in amastigotes revealed characteristic sequence motifs in 3'-untranslated regions that have been linked to translational control elements. This suggests that proteome data sets may be used to identify regulatory elements in mRNAs. Last but not least, at 6% coverage the proteome identified all vaccine antigens tested to date. Thus, the present data set provides a valuable resource for selection of candidate vaccine antigens."
"38","Murine CD146 is widely expressed on endothelial cells and is recognized by the monoclonal antibody ME-9F1.","Schrage, Loddenkemper, Erben, Lauer, Hausdorf, Jungblut, Johnson, Knolle, Zeitz, Hamann, Klugewitz","2008","The endothelium plays an important role in the exchange of molecules, but also of immune cells between blood and the underlying tissue. The endothelial molecule S-Endo 1 antigen (CD146) is preferentially located at endothelial junctions and has been claimed to support endothelial integrity. In this study we show that the monoclonal antibody ME-9F1 recognizes the extracellular portion of murine CD146. Making use of ME-9F1 we found CD146 highly expressed and widely spread on endothelial cells in the analyzed murine tissues. In contrast to humans that express CD146 also on T cells or follicular dendritic cells, murine CD146 albeit at low levels was only found on a subset of NK1.1+ cells. The antibody against murine CD146 is useful for immunomagnetic sorting of primary endothelial cells not only from the liver but from various other organs. In vitro, no evidence was seen that the formation and integrity of endothelial monolayers or the transendothelial migration of T cells was affected by antibody binding to CD146 or by crosslinking of the antigen. This makes the antibody ME-9F1 an excellent tool especially for the ex vivo isolation of murine endothelial cells intended to be used in functional studies."
"39","Proteome analysis of apoptosis signaling by S-trityl-L-cysteine, a potent reversible inhibitor of human mitotic kinesin Eg5.","Kozielski, Skoufias, Indorato, Saoudi, Jungblut, Hustoft, Strozynski, Thiede","2008","Mitotic kinesins represent potential drug targets for anticancer chemotherapy. Inhibitors of different chemical classes have been identified that target human Eg5, a kinesin responsible for the establishment of the bipolar spindle. One potent Eg5 inhibitor is S-trityl-L-cysteine (STLC), which arrests cells in mitosis and exhibits tumor growth inhibition activity. However, the underlying mechanism of STLC action on the molecular level is unknown. Here, cells treated with STLC were blocked in mitosis through activation of the spindle assembly checkpoint as shown by the phosphorylated state of BubR1 and the accumulation of mitosis specific phosphorylation on histone H3 and aurora A kinase. Using live cell imaging, we observed prolonged mitotic arrest and subsequent cell death after incubation of GFP-alpha-tubulin HeLa cells with STLC. Activated caspase-9 occurred before cleavage of caspase-8 leading to the accumulation of the activated executioner caspase-3 suggesting that STLC induces apoptosis through the intrinsic apoptotic pathway. Proteome analysis following STLC treatment revealed 33 differentially regulated proteins of various cellular processes, 31 of which can be linked to apoptotic cell death. Interestingly, four identified proteins, chromobox protein homolog, RNA-binding Src associated in mitosis 68 kDa protein, stathmin, and translationally controlled tumor protein can be linked to mitotic and apoptotic processes."
"40","Intermediate-type 20 S proteasomes in HeLa cells: ""asymmetric"" subunit composition, diversity and adaptation.","Klare, Seeger, Janek, Jungblut, Dahlmann","2007","The 20 S proteasomes are cylinder-shaped heteromeric dimers with a subunit configuration of alpha7, beta7, beta7, alpha7. Replacement of the three active site-containing standard beta-subunits (beta1, beta2, beta5) by immuno-beta-subunits (beta1i, beta2i, beta5i) results in formation of 20 S immuno-proteasomes, while only partial replacement leads to intermediate-type proteasomes. Synthesis of immuno-subunits can be induced by interferon-gamma, which causes a complete transformation of three subtypes of standard proteasomes into three subtypes of intermediate-type proteasomes in HeLa cells, a process that results in a change in the proteolytic activities of the enzymes. HeLa cells producing the proteasome beta1-subunit tagged with the Fc region-binding ZZ domain of protein A were grown in the presence of interferon-gamma. From these cells, we have purified 20 S proteasomes by using IgG-affinity resin and analysed them by 2D PAGE. Our study showed that subunit replacement can be confined to one half of the proteasome cylinder, resulting in the formation of intermediate-type proteasomes with ""asymmetric"" subunit composition. Analysis of proteasomes purified from the cytoplasm, nucleoplasm, and microsomes of HeLa S3 cells reveals that all three compartments are furnished with intermediate-type proteasomes of different subtype and subunit composition, exhibiting different specific proteolytic activities."

The B. amyloliquefaciens FZB42 genome reveals an unexpected potential to produce secondary metabolites, including the polyketides bacillaene and difficidin. More than 8.5% of the genome is devoted to synthesizing antibiotics and siderophores by pathways not involving ribosomes.

"42","Experimental determination of translational starts using peptide mass mapping and tandem mass spectrometry within the proteome of Mycobacterium tuberculosis.","Rison, Mattow, Jungblut, Stoker","2007","Identification of protein translation start sites is largely a bioinformatics exercise, with relatively few confirmed by N-terminal sequencing. Translation start site determination is critical for defining both the protein sequence and the upstream DNA which may contain regulatory motifs. It is demonstrated here that translation start sites can be determined during routine protein identification, using MALDI-MS and MS/MS data to select the correct N-terminal sequence from a list of alternatives generated in silico. Applying the method to 13 proteins from Mycobacterium tuberculosis, 11 predicted translational start sites were confirmed, and two reassigned. The authors suggest that these data (be they confirmation or reassignments) are important for the annotation of both this genome and those of organisms with related genes. It was also shown that N-acetylation, reported to be rare in prokaryotes, was present in three of the 13 proteins (23 %), suggesting that in the mycobacteria this modification may be common, and an important regulator of protein function, although more proteins need to be analysed. This method can be performed with little or no additional experimental work during proteomics investigations."

The aim of this study was to identify the nature of synovial exosomes from patients with different rheumatic diseases and to examine their potential autoantigenic content, which may be involved in the induction of an autoimmune response."

In the current study, we demonstrate that this is possible with two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE) and mass spectrometry by presenting clear evidence of in vivo N-terminal alpha A crystallin truncation and relating this newly detected protein species to alpha crystallin activity regulation by protease cleavage in the healthy young murine lens. We assess the present state of technology and suggest a shift in resources and paradigm for the routine attainment of the protein species level in proteomics."

Over the past years, many quantitative proteomic methods have been developed. Here, 20S proteasome subtypes isolated from rat were compared by four approaches based on the combination of isotope-coded affinity tag (ICAT), 2-DE, LC and ESI and MALDI MS: (i) 2-DE, (ii) ICAT/2-DE MALDI-MS, (iii) ICAT/LC-ESI-MS, (iv) ICAT/LC-MALDI-MS. A definite qualitative advantage of 2-DE gels was the separation of all known protein species, the identification of cysteine sulfoxide of alpha-4 (RC6-IS) and N-terminal acetylation of several subunits. Furthermore, quantitative differences between the standard subunits beta-2, and beta-5 and their immunosubunits were only detected by 2-DE image analysis revealing a higher replacement of standard- by immuno-beta-subunits in subtype IV. It was obvious that for relative quantification only protein spot and mass peaks with a certain level of intensity displayed acceptable values of SD. However, ICAT in conjunction with LC/MALDI-MS was the most accurate method for quantification. The experimental data of this investigation are accessible via http://www.mpiib-berlin.mpg.de/2D-PAGE/."
"46","Eye lens proteomics.","Hoehenwarter, Klose, Jungblut","2006","The eye lens is a fascinating organ as it is in essence living transparent matter. Lenticular transparency is achieved through the peculiarities of lens morphology, a semi-apoptotic process where cells elongate and loose their organelles and the precise molecular arrangement of the bulk of soluble lenticular proteins, the crystallins. The 16 crystallins ubiquitous in mammals and their modifications have been extensively characterized by 2-DE, liquid chromatography, mass spectrometry and other protein analysis techniques. The various solubility dependant fractions as well as subproteomes of lenticular morphological sections have also been explored in detail. Extensive post translational modification of the crystallins is encountered throughout the lens as a result of ageing and disease resulting in a vast number of protein species. Proteomics methodology is therefore ideal to further comprehensive understanding of this organ and the factors involved in cataractogenesis."

To identify proteins of Mycobacterium tuberculosis unique to the intraphagosomal phase, mycobacteria were purified from phagosomes of infected murine bone marrow-derived macrophages and analyzed by high-resolution 2-DE and MS. Protein patterns of intraphagosomally grown M. tuberculosis were compared with those of broth-cultured mycobacteria. The analysis revealed 11 mycobacterial proteins exclusively detected in intraphagosomal mycobacteria. Some of these proteins are involved in metabolism and cell envelope synthesis, such as the lipid carrier protein Rv1627c, and the conserved hypothetical protein Rv1130 that shows homology to a virulence-associated protein of Legionella pneumophila. The relevance of these proteins as factors enabling intracellular survival of M. tuberculosis is being discussed."
"48","Selenium-binding protein 2, the major hepatic target for acetaminophen, shows sex differences in protein abundance.","Mattow, Demuth, Haeselbarth, Jungblut, Klose","2006","Liver samples from female and male mice of two subspecies, Mus musculus musculus and Mus musculus domesticus, were investigated by a combination of 2-DE and MALDI-MS. The image analysis of the generated 2-DE patterns revealed several protein spots with significant differences in intensity/abundance between the sexes. Seven protein spots, which were prominent in 2-DE patterns of male mice, but which showed very low intensities in females, were identified as selenium-binding protein 2 (SBP2) also known as 56-kDa acetaminophen-binding protein. Edman degradation indicated that at least three of these protein spots represent N-terminally truncated SBP2 variants. Furthermore, it was shown that the observed differences in SBP2 abundance correlate with sex differences in transcription of the gene encoding SBP2, selenbp2, as revealed by RT-PCR and restriction digest as well as sequence analysis of the products. Since SBP2 has been described as the major target for acetaminophen in mouse liver cytosol, these findings are discussed with respect to their possible relevance for sex differences in acetaminophen-mediated toxicity, which have been described in a variety of mammals including mice and rats."

Inhalation infection with B. anthracis, the etiological agent of anthrax, is almost always lethal, yet cutaneous infections usually remain localized and resolve spontaneously. Neutrophils are typically recruited to cutaneous but seldom to other forms of anthrax infections, raising the possibility that neutrophils kill B. anthracis. In this study we infected human neutrophils with either spores or vegetative bacteria of a wild-type strain, or strains, expressing only one of the two major virulence factors. The human neutrophils engulfed B. anthracis spores, which germinated intracellularly and were then efficiently killed. Interestingly, neutrophil killing was independent of reactive oxygen species production. We fractionated a human neutrophil granule extract by high-performance liquid chromatography and identified alpha-defensins as the component responsible for B. anthracis killing. These data suggest that the timely recruitment of neutrophils can control cutaneous infections and possibly other forms of B. anthracis infections, and that alpha-defensins play an important role in the potent anti-B. anthracis activity of neutrophils."

This pathogen elicits a range of phenotypic responses in infected cultured AGS gastric epithelial cells, including expression of proinflammatory genes and changes in the actin cytoskeleton. Some of these responses are mediated by the type IV secretion system (T4SS) encoded by the cag pathogenicity island. We have used two global approaches, namely 2-DE combined with PMF and cDNA expression array analyses, to study in both a comprehensive and quantitative manner the protein profile and the temporal patterns of mRNA accumulation in AGS cells upon infection with H. pylori and isogenic T4SS mutants. We identified 140 transcripts and detected 190 protein species that were differentially regulated upon infection. Infection with wild-type H. pylori induced expression of a variety of host genes and changes in protein pattern involved in transcriptional responses, cell shape regulation and signal transduction. Among them, some were differentially regulated in a cag PAI-dependent manner, as shown by both the proteomic and cDNA expression array approaches. While 2-DE and PMF allowed us to examine the protein profiles in the infected host, array analysis enabled us to demonstrate dynamic temporal changes in host gene expression profile. In conclusion, our combined application of the two global approaches provides further molecular details on how the host cell responds to infection by H. pylori and its isogenic T4SS mutants on both transcriptional and protein levels. The findings pinpoint host proteins such as serine/threonine and tyrosine kinases, transcription factors, cell cycle related components and actin cytoskeletal signaling molecules as potential targets of individual H. pylori virulence determinants. This study serves as a basis for future work on transcription and proteome analyses of the H. pylori infection model."

We report here the identification of GarA (Rv1827), a Forkhead-associated (FHA) domain-containing protein, as a putative physiological substrate of PknB, an essential Ser/Thr protein kinase from Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Using a global proteomic approach, GarA was found to be the best detectable substrate of the PknB catalytic domain in non-denatured whole-cell protein extracts from M. tuberculosis and the saprophyte Mycobacterium smegmatis. Enzymological and binding studies of the recombinant proteins demonstrate that docking interactions between the activation loop of PknB and the C-terminal FHA domain of GarA are required to enable efficient phosphorylation at a single N-terminal threonine residue, Thr22, of the substrate. The predicted amino acid sequence of the garA gene, including both the N-terminal phosphorylation motif and the FHA domain, is strongly conserved in mycobacteria and other related actinomycetes, suggesting a functional role of GarA in putative STPK-mediated signal transduction pathways. The ensuing model of PknB-GarA interactions suggests a substrate recruitment mechanism that might apply to other mycobacterial kinases bearing multiple phosphorylation sites in their activation loops."

The complete ten day old lens proteome of Mus musculus C57BL/6J was resolved into 900 distinct spots by large gel carrier ampholyte based 2-DE. The predicted amino acid sequences of all 16 crystallins ubiquitous in mammals were corroborated by mass spectrometry (MS). In detailed individual spot analyses, the primary structure of the full murine C57BL/6J beaded filament component phakinin CP49 was sequenced by liquid chromatography/electrospray ionization-tandem MS and amended at two positions. This definitive polypeptide sequence was aligned to the mouse genome, thus identifying the entire C57BL/6J genomic coding region. Also, two murine C57/6J polypeptides, both previously classified as gamma F crystallin, were clearly distinguished by MS and electrophoretic mobility. Both were assigned to their respective genes, one of the polypeptides was reclassified as C57BL/6J gamma E crystallin. Building on these data and previous investigations an updated crystallin reference map was put forth and several non crystallin lenticular components were examined.

One main technological goal of proteome analyses beside high sensitivity and automation was the comprehensive analysis of proteins. Therefore, the protein species level with the essential information on co- and post-translational modifications must be achieved. The power of peptide mass fingerprinting for protein identification was described here, as exemplified by the identification of protein species with high molecular masses (spectrin alpha and beta), low molecular masses (elongation factor EF-TU fragments), splice variants (alpha A crystallin), aggregates with disulfide bridges (alkylhydroperoxide reductase), and phosphorylated proteins (heat shock protein 27). Helpful tools for these analyses were the use of the minimal protein identifier concept and the software program MS-Screener to remove mass peaks assignable to contaminants and neighbor spots."

Our aim is to establish a dynamic two-dimensional electrophoresis-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (2-DE-PAGE) database with multiple subproteomes of H. pylori (http://www.mpiib-berlin.mpg.de/2D-PAGE) which facilitates identification of bacterial proteins important in pathogen-host interactions. Using a proteomic approach, we investigated the protein composition of two H. pylori fractions: soluble proteins and structure-bound proteins (including membrane proteins). Both fractions differed markedly in the overall protein composition as determined by 2-DE. The 50 most abundant protein spots in each fraction were identified by peptide mass fingerprinting. We detected four cag PAI proteins, numerous outer membrane proteins (OMPs), the vacuolating cytotoxin VacA, other potential virulence factors, and few ribosomal proteins in the structure-bound fraction. In contrast, catalase (KatA), gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase (Ggt), and the neutrophil-activating protein NapA were found almost exclusively in the soluble protein fraction. The results presented here are an important complement to genome sequence data, and the established 2-D PAGE maps provide a basis for comparative studies of the H. pylori proteome. Such subproteomes in the public domain will be effective instruments for identifying new virulence factors and antigens of potential diagnostic and/or curative value against infections with this important pathogen."

Eight ESAT-6 protein species were analyzed in detail by peptide mass fingerprinting matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-mass spectrometry as well as by electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry. An N-terminal Thr acetylation was identified in four species and a C-terminal truncation was identified in two species. In 2-DE blot overlay assays, the recombinant 10 kDa culture filtrate protein (CFP10) discriminated N-terminal acetylated and nonacetylated ESAT-6 by differential interaction, whereas removal of the C-terminal 11 residues of ESAT-6 had no effects thereon. This example shows that the access to the protein species level can be a prerequisite to understand regulation of protein-protein interaction."

"61","The Helicobacter pylori CagA protein induces tyrosine dephosphorylation of ezrin.","Selbach, Moese, Backert, Jungblut, Meyer","2004","Helicobacter pylori is one of the most wide-spread bacterial pathogens and infects the human stomach to cause diseases, such as gastritis, gastric ulceration, and gastric cancer. A major virulence determinant is the H. pylori CagA protein (encoded by the cytotoxin-associated gene A) which is translocated from the bacteria into the cytoplasm of host cells by a type IV secretion system. In the host cell, CagA is phosphorylated on tyrosine residues and induces rearrangements of the actin cytoskeleton. We have previously shown that tyrosine-phosphorylated CagA inhibits the catalytic activity of Src family kinases and induces tyrosine dephosphorylation of several host cell proteins. Here, we identified one of these proteins as ezrin by a combination of preparative gel electrophoresis, two-dimensional electrophoresis (2-DE) and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS). Specific pharmacological inhibition of Src family kinases also induces ezrin dephosphorylation. Therefore, ezrin dephosphorylation appears to be induced by CagA-mediated Src inactivation. Ezrin is the founding member of the ezrin-radixin-moesin (ERM) family of proteins which are signalling integrators at the cell cortex. Since ezrin is a component of microvilli and a linker protein between actin filaments and membrane proteins, this observation has important implications for H. pylori pathogenesis and might also help to explain the development of gastric cancer."
"62","Action and reaction: Chlamydophila pneumoniae proteome alteration in a persistent infection induced by iron deficiency.","Wehrl, Meyer, Jungblut, Müller, Szczepek","2004","Chlamydophila pneumoniae is an obligate intracellular pathogen implicated in a variety of acute and chronic diseases. Long-term infections are associated with a persistent life stage, in which bacteria can stay for years. They are less accessible to antibiotic treatment but still prone to sustain an inflammatory response. Different in vitro models have been established to mimic and characterize chlamydial persistency. For C. pneumoniae and Chlamydia trachomatis, altered metabolic activities and changed antigenic profiles compared to acute infections have been reported. Most studies including transcriptome and proteome analyses describe persistency induced by IFNgamma treatment. Here, we use iron depletion of the infected cell culture that also leads into persistent infection. We describe differently regulated proteins found by subtractive proteome analysis comparing two early stages of infection with and without addition of the iron chelator deferoxamine-mesylate. While only one bacterial protein was up-regulated during iron deficiency up to 24 h post infection (p.i.), 11 were found to be up-regulated and eight to be down-regulated from 24-48 h p.i. Two down-regulated proteins could be identified by peptide mass fingerprinting as thioredoxin reductase and chromosome partitioning protein (ParB). The latter is involved in chromosome segregation. Thus, using a comparative approach we identified on a proteome level down-regulation of ParB in persistent chlamydial forms, which is in agreement with previous results describing changes in cell division and atypical altered morphology of persistent Chlamydiae."

In this study, we report on the analysis of the sarcosine-insoluble outer membrane fraction of B. henselae ATCC 49882 Houston-1 by one-dimensional sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (1-D SDS-PAGE) and two-dimensional nonequilibrium pH gradient polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (2-D NEPHGE). Protein species were identified by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight-mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS) and subsequent database query against the B. henselae genome sequence. Subcellular fractionation, application of the ionic detergent lauryl sarcosine, assessment of trypsin sensitivity, and heat modifiability of surface-exposed proteins represented valuable tools for the analysis of the outer membrane subproteome of B. henselae. 2-D NEPHGE was applied to display and catalogue a substantial number of proteins associated with the B. henselae sarcosine-insoluble outer membrane fraction, resulting in the establishment of a first 2-D reference map of this compartment. Thus, 53 distinct protein species associated with the outer membrane subproteome fraction were identified. This study provides novel insights into the membrane biology and the associated putative virulence factors of this pathogen of increasing medical importance."
"65","Proteome comparison of Vibrio cholerae cultured in aerobic and anaerobic conditions.","Kan, Habibi, Schmid, Liang, Wang, Wang, Jungblut","2004","The pathogen Vibrio cholerae causes severe diarrheal disease in humans. This environmental inhabitant has two distinct life cycles, in the environment and in the human small intestine, in which it differs in its multiplication behavior and virulence expression. Anaerobiosis, limitation of some nutrient elements, and excess burden from host metabolism reactants are the major stresses for V. cholerae living in intestine, in comparison to conditions in the environment and laboratory medium. For an insight into the response of V. cholerae to different microenvironments, we cultured the bacteria in aerobic and anaerobic conditions, and compared the whole cell proteome by two-dimensional electrophoresis. Among the protein spots identified, some protein species involved in aerobic respiration and the nutrient carbohydrate transporters were found to be more abundant in aerobic conditions, and some enzymes for anaerobic respiration and some stress response proteins were found more abundant in anaerobic culture. One spot corresponding to flagellin B subunit was decreased in anaerobic conditions, which suggests correlation with the meticulous regulation of bacterial motility during infection in the host intestine. This proteome analysis is the starting point for in-depth understanding of V. cholerae behavior in different environments."

Novel technologies such as isotope coded affinity tag (ICAT)-liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC/MS) open new insights into protein alterations. The vast amount and diverse types of proteomic data require adequate web-accessible computational and database technologies for storage, integration, dissemination, analysis and visualization. A proteome database system (http://www.mpiib-berlin.mpg.de/2D-PAGE) for microbial research has been constructed which integrates 2-DE/MS, ICAT-LC/MS and functional classification data of proteins with genomic, metabolic and other biological knowledge sources. The two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis database delivers experimental data on microbial proteins including mass spectra for the validation of protein identification. The ICAT-LC/MS database comprises experimental data for protein alterations of mycobacterial strains BCG vs. H37Rv. By formulating complex queries within a functional protein classification database ""FUNC_CLASS"" for Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Helicobacter pylori the researcher can gather precise information on genes, proteins, protein classes and metabolic pathways. The use of the R language in the database architecture allows high-level data analysis and visualization to be performed ""on-the-fly"". The database system is centrally administrated, and investigators without specific bioinformatic competence in database construction can submit their data. The database system also serves as a template for a prototype of a European Proteome Database of Pathogenic Bacteria. Currently, the database system includes proteome information for six strains of microorganisms."

In previous investigations on experimentally induced rat hepatomas, we detected aldose reductase-like protein (ARLP) as a highly significant marker protein. Our present study was intended to look for the presence of similar tumor-associated marker proteins on human hepatocellular carcinomas (HCC). We found several novel tumor-associated protein variants that represent members of the aldo-keto reductase (AKR) superfamily. Human aldose reductase-like protein-1 (hARLP-1) was the most prominent tumor-associated AKR member detected in HCC by 2-dimensional electrophoresis (2-DE) and identified by mass spectrometric fingerprinting. The enzyme was found in 4 distinct forms (hARLP-1, 36/7.4 (kd/pI); hARLP-2, 36/7.2; hARLP-3, 36/6.4; and hARLP-4, 33/7.35). In addition, a human aldose reductase-like protein (hARLP-5, 36/7.6) was identified that differed from hARLP-1 by 1 amino acid (D313N), indicating 2 allelic forms of the human aldose reductase-like gene. A novel antibody directed against common parts of the hARLPs revealed hARLP reactivity in human HCC by immunohistochemistry. Furthermore, aldose reductase (AR) was identified and characterized as a tumor-associated variant. In conclusion, in all investigated human HCCs at least one of the various types of the described tumor-associated proteins of the AKR superfamily was clearly present. Of these HCC samples, 95% were positive for hARLPs as proven by 2-DE analysis and/or by use of the antibody directed against hARLP. Thus, hARLP is a strong candidate for use as an immunohistochemical diagnostic marker of human HCC."
"70","From the inside out--processing of the Chlamydial autotransporter PmpD and its role in bacterial adhesion and activation of human host cells.","Wehrl, Brinkmann, Jungblut, Meyer, Szczepek","2004","Polymorphic membrane protein (Pmp)21 otherwise known as PmpD is the longest of 21 Pmps expressed by Chlamydophila pneumoniae. Recent bioinformatical analyses annotated PmpD as belonging to a family of exported Gram-negative bacterial proteins designated autotransporters. This prediction, however, was never experimentally supported, nor was the function of PmpD known. Here, using 1D and 2D PAGE we demonstrate that PmpD is processed into two parts, N-terminal (N-pmpD), middle (M-pmpD) and presumably third, C-terminal part (C-pmpD). Based on localization of the external part on the outer membrane as shown by immunofluorescence, immuno-electron microscopy and immunoblotting combined with trypsinization, we demonstrate that N-pmpD translocates to the surface of bacteria where it non-covalently binds other components of the outer membrane. We propose that N-pmpD functions as an adhesin, as antibodies raised against N-pmpD blocked chlamydial infectivity in the epithelial cells. In addition, recombinant N-pmpD activated human monocytes in vitro by upregulating their metabolic activity and by stimulating IL-8 release in a dose-dependent manner. These results demonstrate that N-PmpD is an autotransporter component of chlamydial outer membrane, important for bacterial invasion and host inflammation."

ASR1.","Sajidan, Farouk, Greiner, Jungblut, Müller, Borriss","2004","Klebsiella sp. strain ASR1 isolated from an Indonesian rice field is able to hydrolyse myo-inositol hexakis phosphate (phytate). The phytase protein was purified and characterised as a 42 kDa protein accepting phytate, NADP and sugar phosphates as substrates. The corresponding gene (phyK) was cloned from chromosomal DNA using a combined approach of protein and genome analysis, and expressed in Escherichia coli. The recombinant enzyme was identified as a 3-phytase yielding myo-inositol monophosphate, Ins(2)P, as the final product of enzymatic phytate hydrolysis. Based on its amino acid sequence, PhyK appears to be a member of a hitherto unknown subfamily of histidine acid phytate-degrading enzymes with the active site RHGXRXP and HD sequence motifs, and is different from other general phosphatases and phytases. Due to its ability to degrade sodium phytate to the mono phosphate ester, the phyK gene product is an interesting candidate for industrial and agricultural applications to make phytate phosphorous available for plant and animal nutrition."

Only a small fraction of infected people will develop these severe illnesses and a predictive test to identify people at high risk would greatly benefit disease management. Our study aimed to identify conserved bacterial antigens that may be useful for the development of such a diagnostic test. High-resolution immunoproteomics by 2-dimensional electrophoresis of H. pylori 26695 proteins was carried out with sera from infected patients with either duodenal ulcer (n=30) or gastric carcinoma (n=30), 2 clinically divergent conditions. According to their antigen recognition patterns clear groups of patients were identified. Although this classification did not correspond to the clinical status, it may be correlated to other bacterial or host factors that influence the outcome of infection. In general antigen recognition patterns were found to be highly variable, however by utilizing powerful image analysis and statistical tests the recognition of 14 antigenic protein species was found to differ significantly (p<0.01) between both diseases. Particular protein species of GroEL, HyuA, GroES and AtpA appear to be useful surrogate markers for gastric carcinoma detection and consequently should be considered for further prospective studies to assess their predictive value. For one protein species of AtpA, evidence was found that different post-translational modifications may confer different immunogenicities."

This study revealed 137 different proteins, 42 of which had previously been described as secreted. Comparative proteome analysis of CSN from virulent M. tuberculosis H37Rv and attenuated Mycobacterium bovis BCG Copenhagen identified 39 M. tuberculosis-specific spots containing 27 different proteins, representing candidate antigens for novel vaccines and diagnostics in tuberculosis. These included five proteins encoded by open reading frames absent from M. bovis BCG, e.g., early secretory antigen target (Esat6), as well as 22 novel differential proteins, such as acetyl-CoA C-acetyltransferase (Rv0243) and two putative Esat6-like proteins (Rv1198, Rv1793)."

More recently, the combination of liquid chromatography (LC), stable isotope tagging, and tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) has emerged as an alternative quantitative proteomics technology. We have analyzed the proteome of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, a major human pathogen comprising about 4,000 genes, by (i) 2-DE and mass spectrometry (MS) and by (ii) the isotope-coded affinity tag (ICAT) reagent method and MS/MS. The data obtained by either technology were compared with respect to their selectivity for certain protein types and classes and with respect to the accuracy of quantification. Initial datasets of 60,000 peptide MS/MS spectra and 1,800 spots for the ICAT-LC/MS and 2-DE/MS methods, respectively, were reduced to 280 and 108 conclusively identified and quantified proteins, respectively. ICAT-LC/MS showed a clear bias for high M(r) proteins and was complemented by the 2-DE/MS method, which showed a preference for low M(r) proteins and also identified cysteine-free proteins that were transparent to the ICAT-LC/MS method. Relative quantification between two strains of the M. tuberculosis complex also revealed that the two technologies provide complementary quantitative information; whereas the ICAT-LC/MS method quantifies the sum of the protein species of one gene product, the 2-DE/MS method quantifies at the level of resolved protein species, including post-translationally modified and processed polypeptides. Our data indicate that different proteomic technologies applied to the same sample provide complementary types of information that contribute to a more complete understanding of the biological system studied."

This procedure resulted in 960 evaluable mass spectra. Using a new version of our data analysis software MS-Screener we improved identification and tested reliability of automatically generated data by comparing with manually produced data. Antigenic proteins from H. pylori are candidates for vaccines and diagnostic tests. Previous immunoproteomics studies of our group revealed antigen candidates, and 24 of them were now closely analyzed using the MS-Screener software. Only in three spots minor components were found that may have influenced their antigenicities. These findings affirm the value of immunoproteomics as a hypothesis-free approach. Additionally, the protein species distribution of the known antigen GroEL was investigated, dimers of the protein alkyl hydroperoxide reductase were found, and the fragmentation of gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase was demonstrated."

With the increase in sensitivity of peptide mass determination it becomes obvious that even spots looking well separated on a 2-DE gel may consist of several proteins. As a result the number of mass peaks in PMFs increased dramatically leaving many unassigned after a first database search. A number of these are caused by experiment-specific contaminants or by neighbor spots, as well as by additional proteins or post-translational modifications. To understand the complete protein composition of a spot we suggest an iterative procedure based on large numbers of PMFs, exemplified by PMFs of 480 Helicobacter pylori protein spots. Three key iterations were applied: (1) Elimination of contaminant mass peaks determined by MS-Screener (a software developed for this purpose) followed by reanalysis; (2) neighbor spot mass peak determination by cluster analysis, elimination from the peak list and repeated search; (3) re-evaluation of contaminant peaks. The quality of the identification was improved and spots previously unidentified were assigned to proteins. Eight additional spots were identified with this procedure, increasing the total number of identified spots to 455."

In the central nervous system the fibrinolytic system is associated with excitotoxin-mediated neurotoxicity and Alzheimer's disease. Recently binding of the disease associated isoform of the prion protein (PrP(Sc)) to plasminogen and stimulation of t-PA activity have been reported. In this study the interaction of PrP(c) and plasminogen was investigated using chromogenic assays in vitro. We found that plasmin is able to cleave recombinant PrP(c) at lysine residue 110 generating an NH(2)-terminal truncated molecule that has previously been described as a major product of PrP(c) metabolism. We further characterized the proteolytic fragments with respect to their ability to stimulate plasminogen activation in vitro. Our results show that the NH(2)-terminal part of PrP(c) spanning amino acids 23-110 (PrP23-110) together with low molecular weight heparin stimulates t-PA mediated plasminogen activation in vitro. The apparent rate constant was increased 57 fold in the presence of 800 nM PrP23-110. Furthermore, we compared the stimulation of t-PA activity by PrP(c) and beta-amyloid peptide (1-42). While the activity of the beta-amyloid was independent of low molecular weight heparin, PrP23-110 was approximately 4- and 37 fold more active than beta-amyloid in the absence or presence of low molecular weight heparin. In summary, plasmin cleaves PrP(c) in vitro and the liberated NH(2)-terminal fragment accelerates plasminogen activation. Cleavage of PrP c has previously been reported. Thus cleavage of PrP(c) enhancing plasminogen activation at the cell surface could constitute a regulatory mechanism of pericellular proteolysis."

The intention behind constructing a 2-DE database of the water soluble proteins from wild-type mouse mammary gland tissue was to create a reference before going on to investigate cancer-associated protein variations. This database shall be deemed to be a model system for mouse tissue, which is open for transgenic or knockout experiments. Proteins were separated and characterized in terms of their molecular weight (M(r)) and isoelectric point (pI) by high resolution 2-DE. The proteins were identified using prevalent proteomics methods. One method was peptide mass fingerprinting by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-mass spectrometry. Another method was N-terminal sequencing by Edman degradation. By N-terminal sequencing M(r) and pI values were specified more accurately and so the calibration of the master gel was obtained more systematically and exactly. This permits the prediction of possible post-translational modifications of some proteins. The mouse mammary gland 2-DE protein database created presently contains 66 identified protein spots, which are clickable on the gel pattern.

One differentially regulated protein spot was identified by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS) after trypsin digest. Turned on after devision-64 kD (TOAD-64), the identified protein, was present in all gels and, in addition, was up-regulated in the striata but not in the forebrains of the haloperidol-treated animals by 43%. It is concluded that TOAD-64, typically regarded as a marker for commitment to neuronal differentiation during fetal development, also plays a role in adult rat forebrain and striatum and that its concentration is possibly modulated by haloperidol treatment."

The intracellular crystal formation is almost always accompanied by the expression of kappa light chains. However, the exact mechanism for the storage has not been clarified until now. We report a case of generalized CSH in a 73-year-old man who presented with IgA kappa paraproteinemia and paraproteinuria. The initially observed CSH in the bone marrow biopsy was associated with the clinical and pathomorphologic features of a monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance. The progression of disease could not be affected by steroid therapy and the patient died of septic shock 7 months after detection of CSH. At the time of autopsy there was evidence for multiple myeloma and generalized CSH. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis of liver tissue combined with immunoblotting revealed the massive storage of heavy chains of alpha type and light chains of kappa type, each in a monoclonal pattern. Analysis of the stored kappa light chain by nanoelectrospray-ionization mass spectrometry indicated that it belongs to the variable (kappa)I variability subgroup. We identified some unusual amino acid substitutions including Leu59, usually important for hydrophobic interactions within a protein, at a position where it has never been previously described in plasma cell disorders. In conclusion, we present the first case of CSH with molecular identification of the stored kappa subgroup and detection of unusual amino acid substitutions. Our results suggest that conformational alterations induced by amino acid exchanges represent a crucial pathogenic factor in CSH."

Besides clinical signs, the diagnosis of the disease mostly depends on serological tests. To date, there is a lack of information about the F. tularensis antigens that induce antibody response. Therefore, we have started comprehensive mapping of immunoreactive antigens using the attenuated live vaccine strain of F. tularensis LVS originating from the European virulent strain. For this purpose, the immunoreactivity of sera collected from patients suffering from tularemia, together with the control sera of patients with Lyme disease and healthy blood donors, were examined by means of one-dimensional and two-dimensional immunoblotting. Furthermore, whole cell bacterial lysates, isolated integral membrane proteins and basic proteins were exploited as antigens. By this approach more than 80 different immunorelevant antigens were detected. Most of them came from whole cell bacterial lysate and integral membrane proteins. Conversely, only a negligible reaction was found in the case of basic proteins. Forty-five spots were further selected for mass spectrometric analyses and 22 of them were annotated. Among the spots that provided characteristic reactions with sera from patients with tularemia, 60 kDa and 10 kDa chaperonins that occurred in several charge and mass variants, predominated."

Since the low abundance of this secretion system restricted direct analysis by proteomic approaches, several putative proteins were expressed as recombinant products and analyzed by two-dimensional electrophoresis. The map obtained for SPI2 encoded proteins was correlated to the expression pattern of S. Typhimurium. The latter was compared to the proteins induced by SsrAB, the two-component system regulating SPI2 gene expression. Our results exemplify that recombinant expression is a complementary tool for analysis of low abundant proteins or membrane proteins. This approach contributes to the characterization of these proteins by subcellular fractionation. Furthermore, we show that pulse labeling was necessary to analyze growth phase regulated SPI2 proteins that might not be otherwise detectable."
"86","Proteome analysis of secreted proteins of the gastric pathogen Helicobacter pylori.","Bumann, Aksu, Wendland, Janek, Zimny-Arndt, Sabarth, Meyer, Jungblut","2002","Secreted proteins (the secretome) of the human pathogen Helicobacter pylori may mediate important pathogen-host interactions, but such proteins are technically difficult to analyze. Here, we report on a comprehensive secretome analysis that uses protein-free culture conditions to minimize autolysis, an efficient recovery method for extracellular proteins, and two-dimensional gel electrophoresis followed by peptide mass fingerprinting for protein resolution and identification. Twenty-six of the 33 separated secreted proteins were identified. Among them were six putative oxidoreductases that may be involved in the modification of protein-disulfide bonds, three flagellar proteins, three defined fragments of the vacuolating toxin VacA, the serine protease HtrA, and eight proteins of unknown function. A cleavage site for the amino-terminal passenger domain of VacA between amino acids 991 and 992 was determined by collision-induced dissociation mass spectrometry. Several of the secreted proteins are interesting targets for antimicrobial chemotherapy and vaccine development."
"87","Identification of surface proteins of Helicobacter pylori by selective biotinylation, affinity purification, and two-dimensional gel electrophoresis.","Sabarth, Lamer, Zimny-Arndt, Jungblut, Meyer, Bumann","2002","Helicobacter pylori is a widespread human pathogen that can cause gastric ulcers and cancer. To identify surface proteins that may play a role in pathogen-host interactions and represent potential targets for the control of this infection, we selectively biotinylated intact H. pylori with the hydrophilic reagent sulfosuccinimidyl-6-(biotinamido)-hexanoate and purified the labeled proteins by membrane isolation, solubilization, and affinity chromatography. After separation of 82 biotinylated proteins on two-dimensional gels, 18 were identified with comparison to proteome data and peptide mass fingerprinting. Among the identified proteins, 9 have previously been shown to be surface-exposed, 7 are associated with virulence, and 11 are highly immunogenic in infected patients. In conclusion, this generally applicable combined proteome approach facilitates the rapid identification of promising targets for the control of H. pylori and might be applicable to numerous other human pathogens although larger biotinylation reagents might be required in some cases to prevent permeation of porin channels in the outer membrane."
"88","Separation and identification of human heart proteins.","Jäger, Jungblut, Müller-Werdan","2002","Heart failure is not a uniform disease entity, but a syndrome with various causes, including hypertension, ischemia and congenital heart disease, cardiomyopathy, myocarditis and intoxication. During the recent years a number of molecular and cellular alterations have been identified in the diseased heart, but a direct causative link between these changes and functional impairment, medical responsiveness, progression of the disease and the patients' outcome remains to be established. After an accumulation of large amounts of DNA sequence data in genomic projects, scientists have now turned their attention to the central executors of all programs of life, the proteins. In complementation of the genomic initiatives, proteomics based approaches have lined up not only for large-scale identification of proteins and their post-translational modifications, but also to study the function of protein complexes, protein-protein interactions and regulatory and signalling cascades in the cellular network. In concert with genomic data functional proteomics will hold the key for a better understanding and therapeutical management of cardiovascular diseases in the future."

We wondered whether local immunopathology induced by CD8(+) T cells can be explained by tissue-specific differences in proteasome-mediated processing of major histocompatibility complex class I T cell epitopes. Our experiments demonstrate that 20S proteasomes of different organs display a characteristic composition of alpha and beta chain subunits and produce distinct peptide fragments with respect to both quality and quantity. Digests of HSP60 polypeptides by 20S proteasomes show most efficient generation of the pathology related CD8(+) T cell epitope in the small intestine. Further, we demonstrate that the organ-specific potential to produce defined T cell epitopes reflects quantities that are relevant for cytotoxic T lymphocyte recognition. We propose tissue-specific antigen processing by 20S proteasomes as a potential mechanism to control organ-specific immune responses."

A systematic, proteome based approach was chosen to detect candidate antigens of H. pylori for diagnosis, therapy and vaccine development and to investigate potential associations between specific immune responses and manifestations of disease. Sera from patients with active H. pylori infection (n = 24), a control group with unrelated gastric disorders (n = 12) and from patients with gastric cancer (n = 6) were collected and analyzed for the reactivity against proteins of the strain HP 26695 separated by two-dimensional electrophoresis. Overall, 310 antigenic protein species were recognized by H. pylori positive sera representing about 17% of all spots separated. Out of the 32 antigens most frequently recognized by H. pylori positive sera, nine were newly identified and 23 were confirmed from other studies. Three newly identified antigens which belong to the 150 most abundant protein species of H. pylori, were specifically recognized by H. pylori positive sera: the predicted coding region HP0231, serine protease HtrA (HP1019) and Cag3 (HP0522). Other antigens were recognized differently by sera from gastritis and ulcer patients, which may identify them as candidate indicators for clinical manifestations. The data from these immunoproteomic analyses are added to our public database (http://www.mpiib-berlin.mpg.de/2D-PAGE). This platform enables one to compile many protein profiles and to integrate data from other studies, an approach which will greatly assist the search for more immunogenic proteins for diagnostic assays and vaccine design."

N-f-met peptide-specific CTL were generated in vitro when mice previously immunized with gp96 isolated from donor mice infected with L. monocytogenes were stimulated with these peptides. No significant peptide-specific CTL activity was observed in mice immunized with gp96 from uninfected animals. Masses corresponding to one N-f-met peptide were found by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-mass spectrometry on gp96 isolated from C57BL/6 mice infected with L. monocytogenes, but not on gp96 from noninfected mice. Therefore, bacterial N-f-met peptides from intracellular bacteria can bind to gp96 in the infected host, and gp96 loaded with these peptides can generate N-f-met-peptide-specific CTL. We assume a unique role of gp96 in Ag processing through the H2-M3 pathway."
"93","Identification of a tyrosine-phosphorylated 35 kDa carboxy-terminal fragment (p35CagA) of the Helicobacter pylori CagA protein in phagocytic cells: processing or breakage?","Moese, Selbach, Zimny-Arndt, Jungblut, Meyer, Backert","2001","Helicobacter pylori is a very common bacterial pathogen that causes gastric disease by inducing the infiltration of immune cells as an initial event. Virulent H. pylori strains express a type IV secretion system composed of several virulence (Vir) proteins encoded by the cag pathogenicity island (cag PAI). During infection of phagocytic cells (U937, Josk-M and J774A.1) we have detected a de novo tyrosine-phosphorylated protein (p35p-Tyr) with sizes of 30 kDa, 38 kDa or 40 kDa, depending on the H. pylori strain. p35p-Tyr occurrence required functional virB4, virB7, virB10, virB11, virD4 and cagA (cytotoxin-associated gene A) genes encoded by the cag PAI suggesting that p35p-Tyr is a bacterial protein of variable size. We have biochemically purified p35p-Tyr from infected U937 cells. Tryptic peptides of p35p-Tyr determined by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS) identified the carboxy (C)-terminal part of the H. pylori CagA protein. Subsequent analysis by two-dimensional electrophoresis (2-DE) and immunoblotting using anti-CagA antibodies revealed the presence of three stable CagA protein species in phagocytes: (i) 130-140 kDa full-length CagA (p135CagA), (ii) a 100-105 kDa fragment (p100CagA) and (iii) a 30-40 kDa fragment (p35CagA). Unlike p135CagA, p35CagA and p100CagA were also detected in much lower amounts in H. pylori without host cell contact. Therefore, breakage or processing leads to the production of p35CagA and p100CagA, a process that is enhanced after translocation into host cells. MALDI-MS data and the isoelectric point determined by both 2-DE and sequence analysis suggested that p35CagA represents the C-terminal part of CagA and p100CagA corresponds to the remaining amino (N)-terminal fragment. The possible function of CagA in host signal transduction and development of gastric disease is discussed."
"94","Tyrosine phosphorylation patterns and size modification of the Helicobacter pylori CagA protein after translocation into gastric epithelial cells.","Backert, Müller, Jungblut, Meyer","2001","Helicobacter pylori is one of the most common bacterial pathogens that causes a variety of gastric diseases. During infection, the immuno-dominant H. pylori CagA protein is translocated and tyrosine-phosphorylated in gastric epithelial cells. We compared tyrosine phosphorylation patterns of five CagA variants by two-dimensional electrophoresis (2-DE) and immunoblotting studies. Tyrosine-phosphorylated CagA was detected as two distinct protein species in strains P12, P227, G27 and 26695 suggesting that two tyrosine residues of CagA can be phosphorylated both separately and simultaneously. Prediction programs revealed the presence of three putative tyrosine phosphorylation motifs in the sequences of CagA. Mutations in these motifs were identified suggesting that only two putative phosphorylation-relevant tyrosines are present in each CagA variant. CagA of strain J99 was found to be unique because essential codons were mutated in each of the three motifs and, consequently, revealed no tyrosine phosphorylation signals at all. These findings support the view that CagA from different H. pylori strains can be tyrosine-phosphorylated at one or two out of three predicted positions. Additionally, truncated CagA protein species of about 100-105 kDa (p100CagA) have been detected after infection with some of the H. pylori strains. The isoelectric point determined by both 2-DE and sequence analysis suggested that p100CagA represents the amino (N)-terminal part of the protein. Translocation, tyrosine phosphorylation and size modification of CagA might be involved in host signal transduction and development of gastric disease."

Proteins were extracted from whole cell lysates of mycobacteria, separated by high resolution two-dimensional electrophoresis (2-DE) and analysed by mass spectrometry (MS). Silver-stained 2-DE patterns resolved about 1800 distinct protein species, 190 of which had an observed isoelectric point and molecular mass in the range of pH 4 to 6 and 6 to 15 kDa, respectively. Seventy-six spots from this range were excised from Coomassie Brilliant Blue G250-stained gels and analysed by MS, from which 72 were identified. These spots were shown to represent products of as many as 50 different protein-coding genes. Ten genes gave rise to more than one protein species. Eleven spots contained more than one protein. The present study led to the identification of 15 mycobacterial proteins with assigned putative functions, 28 conserved hypothetical proteins and one unknown protein. Most proteins of the latter two groups had previously been predicted at the DNA level only. Six additional spots were shown to comprise proteins encoded by open reading frames that have not been predicted for M. tuberculosis H37Rv by genomic investigations."

Proteins extracted from tissue specimens or cell lysates were separated by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE). Comparative analyses of 2-DE protein patterns were done using computerized image analysis. Selected proteins exhibiting statistically significant abundance alterations comparing healthy and diseased tissues were identified by mass spectrometry. Globally, we have found 57 proteins that exhibited either a significant decrease or increase in amount in pathological tissues, and 18 of these were annotated by mass spectrometry. The alterations in the expression of nine proteins were common for both precancerous and neoplastic tissues suggesting their role in colon tumorigenesis. The epithelial origin of all identified spots was checked in two cell lines Caco-2 and DLD-1 originating from well-differentiated and poorly differentiated colon carcinoma, respectively."
"99","Proteome analysis of rat hepatomas: carcinogen-dependent tumor-associated protein variants.","Zeindl-Eberhart, Klugbauer, Dimitrijevic, Jungblut, Lamer, Rabes","2001","Proteome analysis led to the identification and characterization of tumor-associated protein variants by two-dimensional electrophoresis and mass spectrometry. We focused on comparing the influence of genotoxic nitroso compounds N-methyl-N-nitrosourea, diethylnitrosamine and N-nitrosomorpholine and the nongenotoxic peroxisome proliferator Nafenopin as tumor-inducing agents on the protein pattern of rat hepatomas. We found several tumor-associated variants that represent members of the aldo-keto reductase superfamily. Their induction and/or inhibition was specifically related to the carcinogen used for tumor induction. The most prominent tumor-associated protein, rat aldose reductase-like protein-1 (rARLP-1) (69% sequence identity to lens aldose reductase) and three additional types of rARLP-1 were detected in nitroso compound-induced rat hepatomas, while rat aldo-keto reductase protein-c (Rak-c), a novel tumor-associated variant (65% sequence identity with 3alpha-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase) was discovered in N-methyl-N-nitrosourea-induced hepatomas only. 3Alpha-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase and delta4-3-ketosteroid-5beta-reductase, both liver-specific enzymes, were reduced in amount in all hepatomas investigated, independent of their mode of induction. We conclude, that detoxification enzymes like 3alpha-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3alpha-HSD) and delta4-3-ketosteroid-5beta-reductase (5beta-Red) might be replaced in hepatomas by tumor-associated proteins that are often present in the embryonal state, like the rARLPs or the Rak-c protein. Their induction appears to reflect an altered constitutive pattern of detoxification enzymes, detoxifying toxic aldehydes being induced by nitroso compounds. In contrast, members of the aldo-keto reductase superfamily have not been found in Nafenopin-induced hepatomas. The pattern of tumor-associated protein variants is apparently characteristic for a given group of initiating carcinogens. The hypothesis is proposed that carcinogens leave specific fingerprints at the proteome level of manifest liver tumors."

Emphasis was given to the identification of M. tuberculosis specific proteins, because we consider these proteins to represent putative virulence factors and interesting candidates for vaccination and diagnosis of tuberculosis. The genome of M. tuberculosis strain H37Rv comprises nearly 4000 predicted open reading frames. In contrast, the separation of proteins from whole mycobacterial cells by 2-DE resulted in silver-stained patterns comprising about 1800 distinct protein spots. Amongst these, 96 spots were exclusively detected either in the virulent (56 spots) or in the attenuated (40 spots) mycobacterial strains. Fifty-three of these spots were analyzed by mass spectrometry, of which 41 were identified, including 32 M. tuberculosis specific spots. Twelve M. tuberculosis specific spots were identified as proteins, encoded by genes previously reported to be deleted in M. bovis BCG. The remaining 20 spots unique for M. tuberculosis were identified as proteins encoded by genes that are not known to be missing in M. bovis BCG."

Contrary to several pervious reports, this study did not demonstrate superiority of left ventricular (LV) systolic or diastolic function in athletes compared with controls, either at rest or immediately following exercise. Fasting serum lipids failed to demonstrate a favorable cholesterol profile in the athletes compared to inactive controls. Our results point to superior oxygen utilization (mean peak Vo2 44 vs. 27 mL/kg/min; athletes vs. controls) and the capacity to exercise both aerobically (mean duration 24 vs. 12 min; athletes vs. controls) and anaerobically (mean duration 10 vs. 4 min; athletes vs. controls) as distinguishing parameters between the two cohorts. Our study suggests that in senior athletes, enhanced LV diastolic function may not be as great a contributing factor to athletic performance as previously reported. (c)1999 by CVRR, Inc."

In practice, if the genome of the organism investigated is completely sequenced, using current techniques, all proteins stained by Coomassie Brilliant Blue can be identified. This loss of identification sensitivity of ten to hundred-fold is caused by loss of peptides by surface contacts. Therefore, we performed digestion and transfer of peptides in the lower microl range and reduced the number of steps. The peptide mix obtained from in-gel or on-blot digestion was analyzed directly after digestion or after concentration on POROS R2 beads. Eight protein spots of a 2-DE gel from Mycobacterium bovis BCG were identified using these four preparation procedures for MALDI-MS. Overall, on-blot digestion was as effective as in-gel digestion. Whereas higher signal intensities resulted after concentration, hydrophilic peptides are better detected by direct measurement of the peptide mix without POROS R2 concentration."

The presence of a pathogenicity island (PAI) in H. pylori has been associated with gastric disease. We present evidence that the H. pylori protein encoded by the cytotoxin-associated gene A (cagA) is translocated and phosphorylated in infected epithelial cells. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE) of proteins isolated from infected AGS cells revealed H. pylori strain-specific and time-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of several 125-135 kDa and 75-80 kDa proteins. Immunoblotting studies, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS), cell fractionation and confocal microscopy demonstrated that one of the 125-135 kDa proteins represents the H. pylori CagA protein, which is translocated into the host cell membrane and the cytoplasm. Translocation of CagA was dependent on functional cagA gene and virulence (vir) genes of a type IV secretion apparatus composed of virB4, virB7, virB10, virB11 and virD4 encoded in the cag PAI of H. pylori. Our findings support the view that H. pylori actively translocates virulence determinants, including CagA, which could be involved in the development of a variety of gastric disease."

Those studies, suggesting no effect of exercise training, have not examined highly trained endurance athletes or their LVDF responses after exercise. We therefore compared LVDF characteristics in a group of older highly trained endurance athletes (n = 12, mean age 69 years, range 65-75) and a group of sedentary control subjects (n = 12, mean age 69 years, range 65-73) with no cardiovascular disease. For all subjects, M-mode and Doppler echocardiographic data were obtained at rest. After baseline studies, subjects underwent graded, maximal cardiopulmonary treadmill exercise testing using a modified Balke protocol. Breath-by-breath respiratory gas analysis and peak exercise oxygen consumption (VO(2)max) measurements were obtained. Immediately after exercise and at 3-6 minutes into recovery, repeat Doppler echocardiographic data were obtained for determination of LVDF parameters. VO(2)max (44 +/-6.3 vs 27+/-4.2 ml/kg/min, P<0.001), oxygen consumption at anaerobic threshold (35+/-5.4 vs 24+/-3.8 ml/kg/min, P<0.001), exercise duration (24+/-3 vs 12+/-6 minutes, P<0.001), and left ventricular mass index (61+/-13 vs 51+/-7.8 kg/m(2), P<0.05) were greater in endurance athletes than in sedentary control subjects, whereas body mass index was lower (22+/-1.7 vs 26+/-3.4 kg/m(2), P<0.001). No differences in any of the LVDF characteristics were observed between the groups with the exception of a trend toward a lower atrial filling fraction at rest in the endurance athlete group versus the control subjects (P = 0.07). High-intensity endurance exercise training promotes exceptional peak exercise oxygen consumption and cardiovascular stamina but does not appear to alter normative aging effects on left ventricular diastolic function."

Proteins with a sequence coverage of at least 30% were introduced in the database. This sequence coverage could not always be obtained by using only the matrix alpha-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (CHCA) for the mass analysis. Therefore, an additional mass spectrum was recorded by using 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid (DHB). Usually, additional mass peaks were detected and together with the mass spectrum of CHCA this resulted in the desired sequence coverage."

The biochemical effects of selenium depletion in the myocardium are, however, not yet known. Therefore, we investigated the changes in the myocardial protein pattern in rats after long-term selenium deficiency. The myocardial proteins were analyzed in samples from five selenium-depleted rats (Se-deficient group) and five rats supplied with adequate amounts of the element (Se-adequate group). Isoelectric focusing (IEF) with carrier ampholytes on large 2-DE gels was used for the separation of proteins in the first dimension and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) for the second dimension. The protein patterns were evaluated by means of a computer-assisted gel analysis system. The biochemical identification of the proteins of interest was achieved by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI) or immunoblotting. On average, 588 +/- 68 protein spots were found on the gels. No significant difference in spot numbers existed between the groups. A pattern of 270 spots with identical positions was found on every gel; 247 of these spots were not saturated and used for quantitative comparison. Thirty-five, i.e., 14 %, differed significantly in their relative intensity in the two groups. Twenty-eight protein spots were decreased in the Se-deficient group and seven were increased. Sarcomeric creatine kinase M chain, alpha-myosin heavy chain (alpha-MHC) and myosin light chain 1 and 2 (MLC 1 and 2) were largely decreased in Se-deficiency. Three protein spots were increased by more than twofold or appeared only in the Se-deficient group. A mitochondrial creatine kinase was identified in this group. The results suggest that selenium deficiency affects myocardial energy metabolism and contractile proteins. These changes probably reflect non-specific alterations in heart failure."

After sequencing the complete genome of two strains, 26695 and J99, we have approached the demanding task of investigating the functional part of the genetic information containing macromolecules, the proteome. The proteins of three strains of H. pylori, 26695 and J99, and a prominent strain used in animal models SS1, were separated by a high-resolution two-dimensional electrophoresis technique with a resolution power of 5000 protein spots. Up to 1800 protein species were separated from H. pylori which had been cultivated for 5 days on agar plates. Using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS) peptide mass fingerprinting we have identified 152 proteins, including nine known virulence factors and 28 antigens. The three strains investigated had only a few protein spots in common. We observe that proteins with an amino acid exchange resulting in a net change of only one charge are shifted in the two-dimensional electrophoresis (2-DE) pattern. The expression of 27 predicted conserved hypothetical open reading frames (ORFs) and six unknown ORFs were confirmed. The growth conditions of the bacteria were shown to have an effect on the presence of certain proteins. A preliminary immunoblotting study using human sera revealed that this approach is ideal for identifying proteins of diagnostic or therapeutic value. H. pylori 2-DE patterns with their identified protein species were added to the dynamic 2D-PAGE database (http://www.mpiib-berlin.mpg.de/2D-PAGE/). This basic knowledge of the proteome in the public domain will be an effective instrument for the identification of new virulence or pathogenic factors, and antigens of potentially diagnostic or curative value against H. pylori."

Trypsin is the most widely used enzyme for this purpose. Therefore, 104 protein digests from human Jurkat T cells and Mycobacterium were analyzed considering missed cleavage sites, tryptophan oxidation and N-terminal pyroglutamylation. About 90% of the matched peptides with missed cleavage sites could be classified into three groups: (i) lysine and arginine with a neighbouring proline on the carboxy-terminal side, (ii) neighboring lysines/arginines, and (iii) lysines and arginines with an aspartic acid or glutamic acid residue on either the amino- or carboxy-terminal side. The first group is already accounted for by search programs. The number of missed cleavage sites can be increased without reducing the precision of the database search by taking the other two groups into consideration. Peptides with tryptophan were observed in non, singly (+16 Da) and doubly (+32 Da) oxidized forms. The higher oxidized form was only observed with lower intensity in the presence of the lower oxidized form. Peptides with N-terminal glutamine were found always as pyroglutamate (-17 Da), and in the majority of cases in pairs with unmodified glutamine. These data can be used for the refinement of protein searches by peptide mass fingerprinting."

Conversely, the expression of a novel variant of heat shock protein70 and several members of the S100 protein family of calcium-binding proteins (two isoforms of S100A9, S100A8, S100A11 and S100A6) were upregulated in transformed colon mucosa. Despite the variations of the levels of expression of given protein among analyzed samples, all quantitative changes were found to be statistically significant (Mann-Whitney test assuming p < or = 0.05). We conclude that the proteomic approach is useful for the study of complex biological events underlying the process of colorectal tumorigenesis."
"111","Comparison of two-dimensional electrophoresis patterns of heat shock protein Hsp27 species in normal and cardiomyopathic hearts.","Scheler, Li, Salnikow, Dunn, Jungblut","1999","Heat shock protein Hsp27 occurs in a complex pattern in human myocardial tissue. Normal and failing explanted human heart from patients with dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) or ischemic heart failure (IHF), respectively, were analyzed by high resolution two-dimensional electrophoresis (23x30 cm) and Hsp27 immunostaining. Twelve Hsp27 spots in DCM samples were significantly altered in intensity and ten of these were significantly changed in IHF. Four spots (h1, h2, h4, h5) in DCM samples and three spots (h2, h4, h5) in IHF at a molecular mass of 28 kDa were decreased in intensity. In this study, investigating left ventricles of human myocardium, spot h4 was only detected in normal heart samples. On the other hand, spots with a lower molecular mass of 27 kDa (h14, h15, h17, h20, h21) and 22-23 kDa (46, h47, h50) increased in intensity in failing hearts, suggesting that some form of Hsp27 degradation occurs during heart failure."
"112","Comprehensive detection of immunorelevant Borrelia garinii antigens by two-dimensional electrophoresis.","Jungblut, Grabher, Stöffler","1999","Lyme disease is caused by spirochetes of the Borrelia burgdofferi complex and has been reported in many temperate parts of the Northern Hemisphere. The B. burgdorferi complex consists of at least five different species and five genotypes with different pathogenicity. Serodiagnosis was achieved by detection of antigens on one-dimensional (1-D) immunoblots. A systematic and comprehensive approach to elucidate antigens has been started here by the combination of two-dimensional electrophoresis (2-DE) immunoblotting with matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS). Antigens in the proteome of B. garinii BITS were analyzed for their reactivity with sera from patients in early stage (erythema migrans) and late manifestations (neuroborreliosis late, arthritis and acrodermatitis chronica athrophicans) of borreliosis. A strategy to handle the enormous amount of data was developed and 65 antigens were detected, of which 20 were identified. These comprise the known antigens from 1-D immunoblots used routinely in serodiagnosis and additionally the two new antigens, GAPDH and the ABC transporter oligopeptide permease. Several disease-stage unique proteins were detected and some of them identified. The genetic variability between B. garinii strains BITS and 20047, B. afzelii, and B. burgdofferi, sensu stricto, seen on the 2-DE patterns underlines the necessity of the search for additional antigens to improve the serodiagnosis and development of vaccines to be used outside of Northern America. A 2-DE database of B. garinii was built up and is available on the World Wide Web (http://www.mpiib-berlin.mpg.de/2D-PAGE)."
"113","Studies on a local effect of boar seminal plasma on ovulation time in gilts.","Waberski, Kremer, Borchardt Neto, Jungblut, Kallweit, Weitze","1999","Previous studies showed that intrauterine infusion of seminal plasma at the onset of oestrus could advance ovulation in pigs, possibly to enhance the chances of fertilization by optimizing the chronological events of fertilization. This effect has been attributed to a local unilateral mechanism whereby infusion into a single uterine horn advances ovulation in the adjacent ovary. The present study was designed to elucidate possible mechanisms of local signal transduction. In a series of five experiments using 43 gilts, the ovarian response was investigated after infusion of seminal plasma at different sites of the female reproductive tract. The time of ovulation was detected sonographically at 4- or 2-h intervals. Single uterine horn infusion of 100 ml seminal plasma advanced ovulation on the ipsilateral ovary by 9.3 h (mean) compared with the contralateral ovary. Dissection of the ipsilateral isthmus abolished the unilateral seminal plasma effect. Unilateral infusion of 50 microliters or 1 ml seminal plasma or 50 microliters of the concentrated 1-10 kDa fraction in the lower isthmus was ineffective. Application of 5 ml seminal plasma into the tip of a ligated uterine horn lead to 3.6 h (mean) earlier ovulation on the adjacent ovary. In contrast, the infusion of 5 ml NaCl showed no effect. Application of 5 ml seminal plasma in the middle of the uterine horn between two ligatures was ineffective. It is concluded that, for the transduction of the local signal involved in the advancement of ovulation, contact of seminal plasma with the epithelium of the utero-tubal junction is essential."
"114","The dominance of arginine-containing peptides in MALDI-derived tryptic mass fingerprints of proteins.","Krause, Wenschuh, Jungblut","1999","Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS) is a powerful tool for mass finger-printing of peptide mixtures obtained after enzymatic ingel digestion of proteins separated by two-dimensional electrophoresis (2-DE). In the course of a proteome analysis of mycobacteria using mass spectrometric identification, it was found that 94% of the most intense MALDI-MS peaks denote peptides bearing arginine at the C-terminal end. The effect was demonstrated to be equally prominent using an equimolar mixture of the synthetic peptides known to be present in the tryptic digest of the mycobacterial 35 kDa antigen (""synthetic mass map""). In addition, several binary mixtures of synthetic peptides differing exclusively at the C terminus (Arg or Lys) were examined to rationalize the higher sensitivity toward arginine-containing peptides. The extent of the effect described depends on the matrix used and may facilitate a more reliable assignment of mass fingerprint data to protein sequences in databases."

The complete genome of the strain H37Rv of the causative microorganism, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, comprising 3924 genes has been sequenced. We compared the proteomes of two non-virulent vaccine strains of M. bovis BCG (Chicago and Copenhagen) with two virulent strains of M. tuberculosis (H37Rv and Erdman) to identify protein candidates of value for the development of vaccines, diagnostics and therapeutics. The mycobacterial strains were analysed by two-dimensional electrophoresis (2-DE) combining non-equilibrium pH gradient electrophoresis (NEPHGE) with SDS-PAGE. Distinct and characteristic proteins were identified by mass spectrometry and introduced into a dynamic 2-DE database (http://www.mpiib-berlin.mpg.de/2D-PAGE). Silver-stained 2-DE patterns of mycobacterial cell proteins or culture supernatants contained 1800 or 800 spots, respectively, from which 263 were identified. Of these, 54 belong to the culture supernatant. Sixteen and 25 proteins differing in intensity or position between M. tuberculosis H37Rv and Erdman, and H37Rv and M. bovis BCG Chicago, respectively, were identified and categorized into protein classes. It is to be hoped that the availability of the mycobacterial proteome will facilitate the design of novel measures for prevention and therapy of one of the great health threats, tuberculosis."

Data organization is imperative for efficient handling of the vast amount of information generated. Thus we have constructed a 2-D PAGE database to store and compare protein patterns of cell-associated and culture-supernatant proteins of different mycobacterial strains. In accordance with the guidelines for federated 2-DE databases, we developed a program that generates a dynamic 2-D PAGE database for the World-Wide-Web to organise and publish, via the internet, our results from proteome analysis of different Mycobacterium tuberculosis as well as Mycobacterium bovis BCG strains. The uniform resource locator for the database is http://www.mpiib-berlin.mpg.de/2D-PAGE and can be read with a Java compatible browser. The interactive hypertext markup language documents displayed are generated dynamically in each individual session from a rational data file, a 2-D gel image file and a map file describing the protein spots as polygons. The program consists of common gateway interface scripts written in PERL, minimizing the administrative workload of the database. Furthermore, the database facilitates not only interactive use, but also worldwide active participation of other scientific groups with their own data, requiring only minimal computer hardware and knowledge of information technology."

In addition they may cause abortion or fetal abnormalities during pregnancy. Despite the clinical importance, diagnosis, treatment and prevention still remain unsatisfactory. Analysis of the parasitic cell determinants, recognized by specific humoral and cellular immune responses, may have important implications for diagnosis, therapy and vaccination strategies. Two-dimensional electrophoresis (2-DE) was used to resolve and compare protein patterns from Toxoplasma gondii strains RH and BK (mouse virulent strains). Comparison of silver-stained gels showed that 35.2% to 60.3% of the spots had the same position. In a second series of experiments, the reactivity of the spots with human sera was tested. Proteins were transferred to PVDF membranes and were detected with sera from different patient groups. Depending upon the immunoglobulin class (IgG, IgM, IgA or IgE) different epitope patterns were observed. Some of the spots seemed to be recognized in different stages of infection. Sera of two patients with similar serology and comparable stage of infection were compared in order to demonstrate an individual immune response."

Proteomics is a rapidly growing research area that encompasses both genetic and environmental factors. The protein composition represents the functional status of a biological compartment. The five approaches presented here resulted in the detection of disease-associated proteins. Calgranulin B was upregulated in colorectal cancer, and hepatoma-derived aldose reductase-like protein was reexpressed in a rat model during hepatocarcinogenesis. In these two investigations, attention was focused on one protein, obviously differing in amount, directly after two-dimensional electrophoresis (2-DE). Additional methods, such as enzyme activity measurements and immunohistochemistry, confirmed the disease association of the two candidates resulting from 2-DE subtractive analysis. The following three investigations take advantage of the holistic potential of the 2-DE approach. The comparison of 2-DE patterns from dilated cardiomyopathy patients with those of controls revealed 25 statistically significant intensity differences, from which 12 were identified by amino acid analysis, Edman degradation or matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS). A human myocardial 2-DE database was constructed, containing 3300 protein spots and 150 identified protein species. The number of identified proteins was limited by the capacity of our group, rather than by the principle of feasibility. Another field where proteomics proves to be a valuable tool in identifying proteins of importance for diagnosis is proteome analysis of pathogenic microorganisms such as Borrelia burgdorferi (Lyme disease) and Toxoplasma gondii (toxoplasmosis). Sera from patients with early or late symptoms of Lyme borreliosis contained antibodies of various classes against about 80 antigens each, containing the already described antigens OspA, B and C, flagellin, p83/100, and p39. Similarly, antibody reactivity to seven different marker antigens of T. gondii allowed differentiation between acute and latent toxoplasmosis, an important diagnostic tool in both pregnancy and immunosuppressed patients."
"119","Comparison of human COP9 signalsome and 26S proteasome lid'.","Henke, Ferrell, Bech-Otschir, Seeger, Schade, Jungblut, Naumann, Dubiel","1999","The human core COP9 signalosome consists of eight subunits which have been identified, cloned and sequenced. The components of COP9 signalosome possess homologies with eight non-ATPase regulatory subunits of the 26S proteasome. These polypeptides of the 19S regulator form a reversibly binding subcomplex called the 'lid'. We isolated the 'lid' from human red blood cells and compared it with the COP9 signalosome complex. In addition to the non-ATPase regulatory polypeptides, we found a high molecular mass ATPase copurifying with the human 'lid'. The COP9 signalosome-associated kinase activity is either not at all or only weakly affected by common kinase inhibitors such as 1-(5-Isoquinolinesulfonyl)-2-methyl-piperazine (H7), 5,6-dichloro-1-beta-D-ribofuranosyl-benzimidazole (DRB) or Wortmannin. Curcumin, a tumor suppressor and effector of AP-1 activation, is a potent inhibitor of the COP9 signalosome kinase activity with a Ki of about 10 microM. Since curcumin is known as an inhibitor of the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) signaling pathway acting upstream of the MAP kinase kinase kinase level, one site of action of the COP9 signalosome might be proximal to regulators on that level."

Furthermore, an additional protein, identified by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization - mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS) as S100A8, exhibited an increased expression in the same specimens of malignant tissues as the S100A9 protein. The immunohistological analysis revealed the accumulation of S100A9 positive cells, macrophages and polymorphonuclear leukocytes along the invasive margin of colorectal carcinoma. The S100A8 protein was found to be produced in the same location. The possible participation of both proteins and, especially, its heterodimeric complex calprotectin in colorectal carcinoma regression could be taken into account."

"124","Peptide mass fingerprint sequence coverage from differently stained proteins on two-dimensional electrophoresis patterns by matrix assisted laser desorption/ionization-mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS).","Scheler, Lamer, Pan, Li, Salnikow, Jungblut","1998","Identification of proteins separated by two-dimensional electrophoresis (2-DE) is a necessary task to overcome the purely descriptive character of 2-DE and a prerequisite to the construction of 2-DE databases in proteome projects. Matrix assisted laser desorption/ionization-mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS) has a sensitivity for peptide detection in the lower fmol range, which should be sufficient for an analysis of even weakly silver-stained protein spots by peptide mass fingerprinting. Unfortunately, proteins are modified by the silver staining procedure, leading to low sequence coverage. Omission of glutaraldehyde increased the sequence coverage, but this improved sequence coverage is still clearly below the sequence coverage starting with Coomassie Brilliant Blue (CBB) R-250-stained spots. Other factors additionally seem to modify proteins during silver staining. By decreasing the protein amount, the advantage of very sensitive detection on the gel is lost during identification, because the resulting low sequence coverage is not sufficient for secure identification. Low-quantity proteins can be identified better starting with CBB G-250 or Zn-imidazol-stained proteins. In contrast, for high-quantity CBB R-250-stained spots, a sequence coverage of up to 90% can be obtained by using only one cleaving enzyme, and up to 80% was reached for medium-quantity spots after combination of tryptic digest with Asp-N- and Glu-C digest."

In human acute septic cardiomyopathy, on the other hand, the negative inotropic impact of TNF alpha on the heart is well documented and frequently ascribed to the induction of inducible nitric oxide (NO) synthase (iNOS) and an enhanced production of NO in the heart. Yet the present study presents evidence that in cardiomyocytes TNF alpha in non-toxic concentrations specifically depresses contractile performance independent of NO. In spontaneously beating neonatal rat cardiomyocytes, TNF alpha in a low, pathophysiologically relevant concentration (10 U/ml, 1-3 days) does not alter basal pulsation amplitude, but blocks alpha- and beta-adrenoceptor-stimulated increase in contractility and beating irregularity and impairs the impact of high extracellular calcium on contractile performance. However, this low TNF alpha-concentration does not suffice to induce iNOS - documented by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction - or enhance nitrite concentrations in the cell culture supernatants as a measure of cellular NO production, neither in the presence nor absence of dexamethasone (0.1 micro M). Only in high concentration - the specific proinflammatory action being documented by an enhanced release of interleukin-6 from cardiomyocytes - TNF alpha (1000 U/mol; 6, 24 h) weakly induces the mRNA for iNOS, with a consecutive moderate rise in cellular nitrite production. TNF alpha-incubation (10-1000 U/ml) does not alter the morphological appearance of the cells displayed by phase contrast microscopy or evoke gross cytotoxicity."

It was found that peptides displaying stable alpha-helical and beta-sheet structures show lower signal intensities than the corresponding analogs having disturbed secondary structures caused by substitution of two adjacent amino acids by their D isomers. Since such substitutions do not affect properties other than the secondary structure propensity, the differences observed are ascribed to this phenomenon or some related effect such as association. The results indicate that the formation of stable secondary structures in peptides may be a possible source of incomplete peptide mass fingerprints resulting from protein digestion and for difficulties in the quantitative evaluation of peptide mixtures via MALDI-MS."

Furthermore, this protein occurred in all specimens collected from patients suffering from IBD and its quantity reflected the increased severity of inflammation. The combination of microsequencing and mass spectrometry led to the identification of the 13 kDa spot as calgranulin B. Our results indicate that the production of calgranulin B is unregulated in inflammatory, preneoplastic and neoplastic lesions of colonic mucosa."

The formation of delta-(L-alpha-aminoadipyl)-L-cysteinyl-thioester in the absence of L-valine was shown by isolation of the enzyme-substrate complex and cleavage of the covalently bound intermediate with performic acid. The dipeptide was recovered as cysteic acid or cysteic acid oxime and detected by HPLC and MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry.

R., Otto, A. & Rabes, H. M. (1994) Identification of tumor-associated protein variants during rat hepatocarcinogenesis, J. Biol. Chem. 269, 14589-14594]. Two-dimensional electrophoresis of rat lens proteins revealed a spot at 37 kDa/pI 6.8 that showed a high degree of identity (98.5%) with rat lens aldose reductase after amino acid sequencing and 80% sequence identity to the rat-hepatoma-derived aldose-reductase-like protein. This suggests that hepatoma-derived aldose-reductase-like protein and rat lens aldose reductase are related proteins encoded by different genes. A different expression profile of these proteins was found in various rat organs. Rat lens aldose reductase is present, in addition to in lens, in heart, brain, muscle, lung, duodenum, kidney, spleen and bone marrow, while the hepatoma-derived aldose-reductase-like protein is found preferentially in hepatomas and in embryonic liver. Though different in organ expression, an identical response was found for both proteins after stimulation with fibroblast growth factor-1 and after exposure to increased glucose concentrations. Since rat hepatoma-derived aldose-reductase-like protein is expressed in embryonic, but not in adult liver, it is assumed that it is expressed in hepatomas as a functionally active embryonal type of aldose reductase during hepatocarcinogenesis. Immunohistochemistry revealed that the hepatoma-derived aldose-reductase-like protein is expressed already in the preneoplastic stage of hepatocarcinogenesis and might potentially serve as a marker enzyme in early hepatic neoplasia."

We have previously demonstrated the generation of inherently echogenic (acoustically reflective) liposomes solely by varying lipid composition and controlling the method of production. In this study, echogenic liposomes composed of phosphatidylcholine (PC), 4-(p-maleimidophenyl) butyryl phosphatidylethanolamine (MPB-PE), phosphatidylglycerol (PG), and cholesterol were conjugated to human gamma globulin to determine the effect of antibody conjugation on liposomal acoustic reflectivity. The liposomes remained highly echogenic following antibody conjugation. Echogenic liposomes were also conjugated to rabbit antihuman fibrinogen to study their ability to target fibrin. Antibody-conjugated liposomes were targeted to fibrin-coated filter paper and slides, thrombi made in vitro, and segments of atheroma in an animal model of atherosclerosis. Liposomes were detected by scanning electron microscopy, radiolabeling, and imaging with intravascular ultrasound. Electron microscopy revealed attachment of antibody-conjugated liposomes to fibrin on slides and to the fibrous plaques of the arterial segments, whereas unconjugated liposomes did not attach. Similarly, conjugated liposomes did not attach to normal arteries, indicating their binding to the arterial segment is directed towards a component of the fibrous plaque. Ultrasound imaging of the thrombi demonstrated surface attachment of the acoustic conjugated liposomes. 125I-Labeled liposomes conjugated to rabbit anti-human were targeted to fibrin-coated paper. Counting specifically bound radioactivity showed that > 84% of applied liposomes remained attached to the fibrin after washing with saline. These results demonstrate the potential of acoustically reflective liposomes for site-specific targeting and acoustic enhancement."

In addition, 17 non-catheterized gilts received infusions of seminal plasma either 0 h (n = 3 gilts), 16 h (n = 7 gilts) or 24 h (n = 7 gilts) after the detection of oestrus. Seminal plasma infusion at the onset of oestrus provoked ovulation in the ipsilateral ovary of the treated horn 8.5 +/- 0.9 h earlier than in the contralateral (control) ovary. Seminal plasma did not influence the LH profile compared with PBS (P > 0.05), but shortened the interval between the LH peak and ipsilateral ovulation to 23.4 +/- 4.0 h compared with 31.8 +/- 3.4 h in the contralateral ovulation (P < or = 0.01). Infusion 16 h after the onset of oestrus reduced the effect to 4.6 +/- 3.8 h with a wide range of 0-8 h (P < 0.01). The effect was more pronounced in gilts with long intervals between the onset of oestrus and contralateral ovulation compared with earlier ovulation on the control ovary. Seminal plasma infusion less than 16 h before contralateral ovulation and 24 h after the detection of oestrus had no effect. It is concluded that transcervical infusion of seminal plasma early in oestrus synchronizes the variable intervals between the onset of oestrus and ovulation in sows by a locally active mechanism."

A high-performance technique was applied, using large gels (23 x 30 cm). Isoelectric focusing with anodic sample preparation and nonequilibrium running conditions (NEPHGE) was combined with sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) in 15% acrylamide gels in the second dimension. The range of pI extends from pH 4.5 to 9.6. Seventy proteins were identified by combinations of amino acid analysis, N-terminal and internal sequencing, immunostaining, matrix assisted laser desorption/ionization-mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS) peptide mass fingerprinting, post-source decay MALDI-MS and ladder sequencing by carboxypeptidase P. The identification of additional proteins, not found in the master gel, was achieved by immunoblotting. Unequivocal identification with high sensitivity and good yield was obtained by combining internal sequencing and MALDI-MS. In-gel digestion, the concentration and purification of peptides in a peptide collecting device, and the improved FRAGMOD program for peptide mass fingerprinting have added to the security and sensitivity of identification. The high-performance human myocardial 2-DE database was built up with proteins detected by the TOPSPOT program. Spots within six sections of the whole pattern are clickable. Protein description includes detailed information about identification, characterization, and links to the related SWISS-PROT, other 2-DE databases and Medline entries. The database is constructed in accordance with four of the rules for a federated database."

The identification of in-gel digested proteins by peptide mass fingerprinting was significantly improve in comparison to blot-digests by using a peptide-collecting device. This device allows the effective purification and concentration of enzymatic digests of low-intensity spots without expensive equipment and is described in detail. Sensitivity in the fmol range was demonstrated by unequivocal identification of bovine serum albumin after sodium dodecyl sulfate--polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Furthermore the high performance liquid chromatography pattern of in-gel digests indicated a 2- to 3-fold higher yield of the separated peptides. Therefore, a higher amount of the peptides was available to perform N-terminal sequencing. The identification of 16 proteins from a high-resolution 2-DE gel map of human myocardium tissue has been achieved by means of this technique. Three of these proteins were associated with changes in spot intensity with dilated cardiomyopathy."

The markers were coupled to the sulfhydryl group of (monovalent) antibody fragments (Fab') by a homobifunctional cross-linker. While the coupling ratios of the poorly water-soluble compound did not exceed 20%, the polyether-containing variant reacted quantitatively. Its suitability for immunolabelling was tested in a study of the mechanism of the transcellular transport of an administered heterologous protein (bovine serum albumin, BSA) through ileal enterocytes of newborn piglets by endocytotic vesicles in comparison to conventional immunogold reagents. The post-embedding technique was employed. The boronated Fab' gave rise to considerably higher tagging frequencies than seen with immunogold, as could be expected from its form- and size-related physical advantages and the dense packing of BSA in the vesicles. The new probe, carrying the antigen-combining cleft at one end and the boron clusters at the opposite end of the oval-shaped conjugate, add to the potential of ESI-based immunocytochemistry."

A standard diet of about 1.5% calcium (Ca) was fed till sacrifice at either 12 or 20 months post OVX when mineral content and histology were studied in representative bone specimens of proximal tibia, iliac crest and lumbar vertebrae. At 4, 8, 12, and 18 months post OVX, total and bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (APt, APb) calcidiol, calcitriol and parathyroid hormone (PTH) were measured in plasma. In young sows OVX did not significantly affect plasma variables except for calcitriol, which was higher at 4 months post OVX. No significant differences between OVX or control animals were observed in the variables of bone chemical and histological analyses, neither 12 nor 20 months post OVX. In multiparous sows OVX significantly increased PTH plasma concentrations at 8 months post OVX and plasma calcitriol, APt and APb at 12 months post OVX. All effects were moderate and transient. OVX did not significantly affect the variables of bone chemical and histological analyses neither 12 nor 20 months post OVX. Although undoubtedly the clinical-chemical changes observed were not accompanied by any histomorphometric signs of osteopenia/osteoporosis, it must be left to future experiments as to whether this resulted from the ample calcium supply provided. This possibility is supported by recent observations showing that porcine osteopenia could be induced by OVX in animals maintained on only 0.75% dietary calcium but not on higher (0.9%) Ca regimens."
"144","Identification of human myocardial proteins separated by two-dimensional electrophoresis with matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry.","Thiede, Otto, Zimny-Arndt, Müller, Jungblut","1996","Disease-associated proteins separated by two-dimensional electrophoresis (2-DE) are often in the femtomole range. Identification of 2-DE separated proteins by sequencing and amino acid analysis is limited to the lower picomole range. Identification down to the femtomole range can be achieved by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS). We optimized the measurement by MALDI-MS for the analysis of proteolytic digests of 2-DE-separated proteins. The direct analysis of peptide mixtures can be used for rapid and sensitive protein identification. In some cases, more information about the protein can be obtained by separating the peptides by micro high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) before employing MALDI-MS analysis. More peptides are found than in the mixtures, and comparison of HPLC patterns can reveal some differences to be post-translational modifications of proteins, even in the case of identical peptide mass fingerprints. Furthermore, carboxy-terminal sequencing by on-target carboxypeptidase P digestion can be used to confirm the obtained result without the need for more material. The search program FRAGFIT was modified and renamed FRAGMOD to include the modifications of methionine and tryptophan oxidation and alkylation of cysteine by acrylamide into the mass search. By applying this procedure, 15 proteins were identified, among them two different putative phosphorylated forms of two proteins, a putative N-terminal blocking group and four dilated cardiomyopathy-associated proteins. The resulting approach for the identification may be used for large-scale investigations of 2-DE-separated proteins."

"146","Oxygenation of biomembranes by mammalian lipoxygenases: the role of ubiquinone.","Schnurr, Hellwing, Seidemann, Jungblut, Kuhn, Rapoport, Schewe","1996","15-Lipoxygenase is implicated in the selective breakdown of mitochondria during red cell maturation by virtue of its capability of directly oxygenating phospholipids. To address the reason of the selectivity for mitochondria, we studied the reaction of pure rabbit 15-lipoxygenase with beef heart submitochondrial particles in vitro. This reaction is characterised by a loss of polyenoic fatty acids, the formation of phospholipid-bound hydroperoxy- and keto-polyenoic fatty acids, and oxidative modification of membrane proteins. The total oxygen uptake exceeds the formation of oxygenated polyenoic fatty acids several times. The excessive oxygen uptake was not inhibited by 3,5-di-tert-butyl-4-hydroxytoluene or by respiratory inhibitors, but was partly suppressed by superoxide dismutase plus catalase, salicylate, or mannitol. Pentane-extraction of the submitochondrial particles abolished the excessive oxygen uptake, whereas reconstitution with ubiquinone- 50 restored it. A marked excessive oxygen uptake did not occur during the analogous reaction with erythrocyte ghosts. It is proposed that ubiquinone-50 triggers the formation of hydroxyl radicals from 15-lipoxygenase-derived hydroperoxy-lipids via a Fenton-type reaction driven by ubisemiquinone radicals. A new prooxidative function of ubiquinone in the biologically programmed degradation of mitochondria in certain types of cells is proposed."

Preparative surgery comprised the detachment of the left uterine horn from the corpus, leaving the caudal end open to the peritoneal cavity but sealing the corpus wound. The left ovary was loosely tied to the ventral abdominal wall for better sonographic distinction. The animals were used in two to four consecutive cycles. After detection of oestrus by the teaser boar, the patent (right) horns were filled by transcervical infusion of 100 ml of a variety of test solutions. Ovulation was probed by transcutaneous sonography at intervals of 4 h thereafter. Native seminal plasma provoked ovulation in the ipsilateral ovary of the treated horn 10.7 h earlier than in the contralateral ovary. This effect was reduced to 7.3 h after charcoal treatment of seminal plasma; addition of 10 micrograms oestradiol restored the effect in full, while 10 micrograms of oestradiol in PBS shortened the time interval to only 3.3 h versus the control ovary. Little effect was seen with oestrone sulfate, none with prostaglandins in PBS or with PBS alone. The preliminary characterization of the nonsteroidal component of seminal plasma advancing ipsilateral ovulation after transcervical infusion suggests a proteinaceous nature. The activity resides in the 1-10 kDa fraction separated by ultrafiltration and is lost after treatment with pronase."

A probe derived from the recently discovered porcine 17 beta-oestradiol dehydrogenase (17 beta-EDH) was used to isolate a 2.6 kb human cDNA encoding a continuous protein of 736 amino acids of high (84%) similarity to the porcine 17 beta-EDH. The calculated molecular mass of the human enzyme is 79,595 Da. Other sequence similarities shared by the two enzymes are: an N-terminal sequence which is similar to that of members of the short-chain alcohol dehydrogenase family; amino acids 343-607 which are similar to the C-terminal domains of a trifunctional Candida tropicalis enzyme and the FOX2 gene product of Saccharomyces cerevisiae; amino acids 596-736 which are similar to human sterol carrier protein 2. The previously cloned human 17 beta-HSD I, II and III are less than 25% identical with 17 beta-HSD IV. mRNA for HSD IV is a single species of 3.0 kb, present in many tissues with highest concentrations in liver, heart, prostate and testes.

Combining 2-DE with microsequencing, amino acid analysis and mass spectrometry protein spots on 2-DE gels may be identified. The sequence information can be used to find the gene. However, by 2-DE not only single protein changes can be detected and investigated on the gene level, but also complex changes of many proteins on a genomic scale."

The native protein was exposed at 4 degrees C to a panel of proteases: thermolysin, subtilisin, pronase, elastase, ficin, bromelain, endopeptidase Lys-C, both in the dimer and the monomer state, and chymotrypsin at pH 8.2 only. The digests were analysed by SDS/PAGE/Western blotting for Coomassie staining and immunostaining. Peptides were sequenced from blots. The majority of cleavage sites in upper domain E (8 out of 11) amassed in the Leu296-Leu310 stretch. Cleavage at Leu319 was seen with subtilisin and at Tyr328 with chymotrypsin. Susceptability to enzymic proteolysis was also pronounced in Thr465-Glu470 at the center of domain E. Three peptides, 13 kDa with thermolysin, beginning at Leu337, 6 kDa and, in low yield, 5 kDa with endopeptidase Lys-C beginning at Asp473 resp. Cys417 were only obtained from the monomer substrate. The various digests featured either 27-23-kDa peptides or mixtures of 17-13-kDa and 12-7-kDa peptides separable by SDS/PAGE. All peptides with N-termini between Leu297 and Ser329 reacted with mAb 13H2. The digests showed high peaks of bound estradiol in the dimer position of 32-kDa fragment controls on density gradient centrifugation at pH 7.4. However, the property of proton-driven dissociation was only preserved in the pronase, elastase and chymotrypsin digests with peptides extending beyond the His547-ArgLeuHis550 motif. The preservation of the estradiol-binding niche in the tightly complexed peptides of domain E was also demonstrated by refilling after steroid removal. The sites exposed to proteolytic enzymes and the epitope for 13H2 attachment are in good agreement with surface probability plots."
"152","A novel strategy to identify maternal and paternal inheritance in the mouse.","Römer, Jungblut, Reik, Otto, Klose","1995","A novel strategy for identifying proteins which reveal maternal or paternal inheritance in the mouse is presented. Using two-dimensional electrophoresis we investigated protein expression patterns of adult liver and different embryonic and extraembryonic tissue in C57BL/6Crl and in DBA/2Crl mice, as well as in their reciprocal hybrids. We found three groups of protein spots which showed maternal or paternal inheritance of quantitative variations. These proteins were characterized by N-terminal or internal amino acid sequencing, by determination of the amino acid composition, by glycoprotein staining and RNA expression analysis. The three proteins identified were: alpha-enolase, cyclophilin and beta-group hemoglobins. The parental effects observed for alpha-enolase and cyclophilin were found to be due to parent-specific post-translational modifications of these proteins. For the beta-group hemoglobins our results suggested parental effects on the transcriptional level."

Using computer assisted analysis (PDQUEST, 4.1) we found reproducible protein patterns in the 18 gels (23 x 30 cm, pH 4-9, molecular weight 10-150 kDa). In the two gels from the same patient, 91% of proteins were identical in their position in the pattern and the relative intensities of these protein species correlated with r = 0.85. Three hundred and two +/- 50 protein species were found in several gels, 186 in all 18 gels. Seven proteins in the DCM group were decreased in their relative intensity by > 100%, six were increased by > 100%. Significant quantitative differences between DCM and control patients were found for 25 protein species. Based on seven external marker proteins, a pH and molecular weight value could be calculated for each protein. So far, 30 protein species have been identified by antibodies, amino acid analysis or sequencing procedures. From the 25 proteins that are significantly different between DCM and controls, three have been identified. Expression of the mitochondrial creatine kinase and alpha cristallin B chain was significantly increased in DCM; the malate dehydrogenase family was also significantly decreased in DCM. Two-dimensional electrophoresis appears to be a powerful method for the detection of disease-associated alterations in the myocardial protein pattern."

Plasma was collected for hormone assays. The monoclonal antibody F1 against the structure-bound 17 beta-estradiol dehydrogenase of porcine endometrial epithelium was applied to rehydrated paraffin sections either as a direct, peroxidase-linked probe or in combination with a fluorescing secondary antibody. The oxidation of estradiol was measured in homogenates of tissue powdered in liquid nitrogen. Immunoreactivity was restricted to endometrial epithelium. In the glandular epithelium, faint dots of fluorescence became visible at day 4, which apparently coalesced to spherical structures of 2-4 microns diameter at the cell basis between days 11 through 17 before disappearing by day 18. A similar distribution was observed for the oxidation products of diaminobenzidine beginning with a faint uniform staining and followed by the appearance of intensely stained basal bodies persisting until day 17. Essentially the same time course was seen in the luminal epithelium but with a different distribution. Immunoreactive material amassed in the apical region of the cells, but the conspicuous aggregations were absent. Time course and intensities of the immunological responses are matched by the enzymatic activity measured in parallel. Both correlate with the plasma progesterone levels, suggesting an induction of the enzyme by the hormone. An involvement of the cytoskeleton in the sequence of subcellular distribution patterns is discussed."

Proteins (150 micrograms) from biopsies (1-3 mg wet weight) were first separated by isoelectric focusing, then applied to large 2-dimensional gels. A computer-assisted system (PDQUEST) was used for spot detection, quantification and comparison of 2-dimensional protein patterns. From a single endomyocardial biopsy about 1000 different protein species were resolved. The spot pattern was influenced by the concentration of protein during sample preparation, by the amount of protein loaded onto the gels and by the development time of silver staining. Variances of spot position in the first and second dimension and in the long diagonals were less than 5%. Coefficients of variance for the spot quantities in 8 gels were 16 +/- 8%. Contaminating blood proteins could be identified in the biopsy patterns. Computer-assisted comparison between cardiomyopathy (n = 5) and controls (n = 5) over the whole gel revealed that 55 protein spots were increased 100%, 27 protein spots decreased 100%. Four proteins showed significant quantitative differences between the cardiomyopathic hearts and controls. Fourteen proteins were identified by amino acid analysis or microsequencing. An isoelectric point and molecular mass grid was laid over the whole gel based on these identified protein species, resulting in approximate isoelectric point values and molecular masses for all other protein species. Thus, myocardial 2-dimensional protein patterns obtained from endomyocardial biopsies can be used for the characterization of cardiac diseases."

In situ peptide mapping with limited proteolysis disclosed a significant relationship between these four individual protein spots. Their different position in 2-DE gels might be due to posttranslational modifications: one of the variants was phosphorylated, three others were modified by glycosylation. The most prominent tumor-associated protein variant of this series (spot 17) was further studied by amino acid analysis and internal amino acid microsequencing. It became evident that this variant is identical to aldose reductase (EC 1.1.1.21).

We resolve 3239 proteins of the human myocardium and tried to identify 33 proteins by amino acid analysis and microsequencing. Twenty proteins were identified by search for the protein-chemical data obtained in the Martinsried Institute Protein Sequence Database. Comparisons of 2-DE patterns of different size, which were obtained in different laboratories, were performed with the result that proteins identified on a 2-DE map of one laboratory can be assigned to spots of 2-DE maps produced by another laboratory. Our results show the usefulness of a myocardial 2-DE database; they can be used in different laboratories and make it possible to generate a collection of important human myocardial proteins in a 2-DE database for comparative studies worldwide."

"163","Linkage of 17 beta-oestradiol dehydrogenase to actin by epsilon-(gamma-glutamyl)-lysine in porcine endometrial cells.","Adamski, Husen, Thole, Groeschel-Stewart, Jungblut","1993","We report on the discovery of interactions of porcine endometrial 17 beta-oestradiol dehydrogenase with actin. The 17 beta-oestradiol dehydrogenase of porcine uteri is an essentially unidirectional enzyme compounded in specialized organelles. The enzyme activity in Brij 35 extracts of the particulate fraction of epithelial cells sedimenting between 1800 and 11,000 g(av). was collected by immunoadsorption and eluted at low pH. The eluate contained three proteins of 32, 45 and 80 kDa as shown by SDS/PAGE and silver staining. They were identified by amino acid sequencing and immunotyping as oestradiol dehydrogenase (32 kDa), actin (45 kDa) and a covalent dehydrogenase-actin complex (80 kDa). Disulphides, aldimines, periodate-degradable bonds and hydrophobic interactions were excluded as linkages in the 80 kDa protein. The epsilon-(gamma-glutamyl)-lysine nature of the covalent cross-link was recognized by narrow-bore h.p.l.c. analysis of enzymic digests of electro-eluted 80 kDa material. An involvement of the actin anchor in positioning of the oestradiol dehydrogenase-containing organelles according to metabolic requirements is discussed."
"164","Classification of mouse liver proteins by immobilized metal affinity chromatography and two-dimensional electrophoresis.","Jungblut, Baumeister, Klose","1993","Mouse liver proteins were classified into metal-binding and non-binding proteins by combining immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography (IMAC) and two-dimensional electrophoresis (2-DE). The proteins were fractionated by three metal ions, Zn2+, Ni2+ and Cu2+, immobilized on iminodiacetic acid and then separated by 2-DE. The total number of protein spots resolved by 2-DE increased approximately twofold when the proteins were prefractionated by IMAC. By establishing 2-DE standard patterns, 371 proteins were selected and then characterized according to their specificity in binding the three different metal ions. Only 48 proteins did not bind to any of the three metal ions investigated. Cu2+ was the most efficient ion in binding different proteins (310) compared to the other metals. Cu2+ bound to 42 proteins specifically and to 268 proteins unspecifically. Both Zn2+ and Ni2+ showed specific affinity only to four proteins."
"165","The 17 beta-oestradiol dehydrogenase of pig endometrial cells is localized in specialized vesicles.","Adamski, Husen, Marks, Jungblut","1993","Two monoclonal antibodies against the 17 beta-oestradiol dehydrogenase of pig endometrial cells have been used in localization studies with immunogold electron microscopy. The antibodies attach both to a fraction of dehydrogenase-rich cytoplasmic vesicles isolated from homogenates and to vesicles of similar appearance in cells. The vesicles are filled with electron-dense material. Their tagging intensity indicates a high degree of specialization. Endometrial cells from mature animals contain a host of dehydrogenase vesicles, and cells from prepubertal animals only a few. Functional aspects of the novel organelle are discussed."
"166","The membrane-bound 17β-estradiol dehydrogenase of porcine endometrial cells: purification, characterization and subcellular localization.","Adamski, Husen, Marks, Jungblut","1992","The membrane-bound 17β-estradiol dehydrogenase of porcine endometrial cells was purified to homogeneity as judged by SDS-PAGE and silver staining of a single 32 kD band. A second, more hydrophobic product of the purification protocol contained additional bands at 45 and 80 kD. The 17β-estradiol dehydrogenase activities of both products exceeded those for 17-one reduction by more than 260-fold. Activities of 3α-, 3β- and 20α-dehydrogenases were absent in either fraction. Polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies raised against the 32 kD protein and the more hydrophobic product precipitated the enzymatic activity and reacted with the 32 and 80 kD bands, but not with the 45 kD band in Western blots. The subcellular localization of the enzyme was studied in sections of intact cells and of isolated organelles using gold sol coated with F(ab')₂ fragments of monoclonal antibody F1. Gold particles were found exclusively over cytoplasmic vesicles of 120-150 nm diameter with electron-dense contents."
"167","Identification of tissue proteins by amino acid analysis after purification by two-dimensional electrophoresis.","Jungblut, Dzionara, Klose, Wittmann-Leibold","1992","Mouse brain proteins were separated by two-dimensional electrophoresis (2-DE). The proteins of a section of the 2-DE pattern were blotted onto hydrophobic membranes and 43 of them were excised and hydrolyzed by liquid-phase hydrolysis. The amino acid composition of these proteins was determined by orthophthaldialdehyde precolumn derivatization and compared with the compositions of known proteins stored in the NBRF sequence database. An identification program named ASA was developed for this purpose. The ASA program includes correction and weighting factors, data reduction by molecular weight windows, and exclusion or inclusion of certain organisms as desired. As a control, eight test proteins and five well-known proteins from mouse brain, all separated by 2-DE, were correctly identified by the program. Out of the 43 brain proteins selected, 19 were identified with high confidence."
"168","Purification and properties of oestradiol 17 beta-dehydrogenase extracted from cytoplasmic vesicles of porcine endometrial cells.","Adamski, Husen, Marks, Jungblut","1992","Porcine endometrial oestradiol-17 beta dehydrogenase was solubilized from the particulate fraction of homogenates sedimenting between 1200 g and 10,000 g by treatment with 0.4% Brij 35 in neutral buffers. The extracts were processed by successive passage through DEAE-Sepharose, Amberlyte XAD-2 and Blue-Sepharose, and the enzyme was collected from the washed affinity matrix at 0.8 M of a 0-2 M-KCl gradient. A genuine oestrone reductase was eluted at 1.9 M-KCl. The dehydrogenase pool was resolved by butyl-Sepharose chromatography into a major (80%) peak (EDHM) eluted at 0.8 M-(NH4)2SO4 and a very hydrophobic fraction (VHF) recovered at 0.1 M. EDHM was further purified by filtration through Sephadex G-200 and cation-exchange chromatography on Mono S. Sephacryl 300 was used for VHF followed by Mono S. Enrichments from the homogenate amounted to 1074-fold for EDHM and 632-fold for VHF. A single silver-stained band at 32 kDa is seen on SDS/PAGE of EDHM, and VHF contains additional bands at 45 and 80 kDa. Polyclonal antibodies (G436) raised against EDHM and the monoclonal antibody F1 raised against VHF recognize the single 32 kDa band in EDHM and both the 32 kDa and 80 kDa bands in composite VHF. The 45 kDa band of VHF reacts with neither. Monoclonal antibody W1 raised against EDHM only recognizes the 32 kDa peptide of EDHM and VHF. The specific activity for oestradiol oxidation amounts to 4081 mu-units/mg for EDHM and to 2402 mu-units/mg for VHF. Both possess a minimal (1/260) endogenous reductase activity and are devoid of 3 beta, 3 alpha- and 20 alpha-dehydrogenases. We consider EDHM to be authentic oestradiol-17 beta dehydrogenase of porcine endometrium. The composite VHF could reflect the situation of the enzyme in vivo or result from aggregations occurring during processing."
"169","Nuclear substrates of protein kinase C.","Beckmann, Buchner, Jungblut, Eckerskorn, Weise, Hilbert, Hucho","1992","Starting from the finding that, for neuronal cells, the nuclear-membrane-associated protein kinase C (PKC) is the so-called 'membrane inserted', constitutively active form, we attempted to identify substrates of this nuclear PKC. For this purpose, nuclear membranes and other subcellular fractions were prepared from bovine brain, and in-vitro phosphorylation was performed. Several nuclear membrane proteins were found, the phosphorylation of which was inhibited by specific PKC inhibitors and effectively catalyzed by added PKC. Combining the methods of two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, in-situ digestion, reverse-phase HPLC and microsequencing, two of these nuclear PKC substrates were identified; the known PKC substrate Lamin B2, which serves as a control of the approach and the nucleolar protein B23. Our data suggest, that, for B23, Ser225 is a site of phosphorylation by PKC."

Amino acid analysis was shown to be a powerful tool in addition to sequencing. The identification of a disease-associated N-terminally blocked protein by internal sequencing was not successful. The twelve identified proteins are the basis of a human myocard 2-DE database."
"171","Estradiol-promoted accumulation of receptor in nuclei of porcine endometrium cells. Immunogold electron microscopy of resting and estradiol-stimulated cells.","Sierralta, Jakob, Thole, Engel, Jungblut","1992","Endometrium was collected by curettage from castrated pigs, either untreated or exposed to estradiol in vivo by intrauterine injection, and processed for electron microscopy. The resin LR Gold was used for embedding, and sections were floated on droplets of 10 nm diameter gold particles, coated with the immunoglobulin-G1 (IgG1) fraction or its Fab2 fragment of a monospecific polyclonal antiserum raised in goats against the C-terminal half of the estradiol receptor. On average, only one gold particle per microns 2 became attached in the cytoplasmic area of untreated cells, whereas four were found over the nuclear area. These figures rose to 2-3/microns 2 and 15-26/microns 2, respectively, within 10 min after exposure to estradiol. The labeling intensities of nuclei in cell clusters and of coprocessed nuclei released from cells ruptured during curettage were identical in all situations. Nuclear pores were frequently tagged after estradiol treatment. The proportions of tagging densities in nuclei of untreated and estradiol-exposed cells corresponded to those of receptor contents measured in extracts of isolated nuclei by ligand binding. This correlation was not seen for the cytoplasmic compartment of untreated cells, the scarce tagging of which is interpreted by hidden antigenic determinants. Our morphological analyses support the conclusions drawn from biochemical data (Sierralta et al., 1992) of an estradiol-promoted translocation of receptor from the cytoplasm into the nucleus."
"172","Estradiol-promoted accumulation of receptor in nuclei of porcine endometrium cells. Comparison of the retention of receptor in nuclei during subcellular fractionation of untreated and hormone-treated cells.","Sierralta, Bortsch, Gaues, Szendro, Jungblut","1992","Nuclei were isolated from porcine endometrium of castrated pigs either unexposed or exposed to estradiol in vivo by two techniques, one of which included a hypotonic step. Aliquots were analyzed for estradiol content. Receptor was extracted from buffered, Surfynol-stabilized suspensions by either (a) KCl alone, (b) in combination with dithiothreitol, or (c) by dithiothreitol with polypentosanesulfate and addition of KCl. The yields rose from a-->c. The same proportional gains with increasing extractant efficacies were obtained from nuclei of unstimulated and estradiol-treated cells. Receptor recovery with extractant ""c"" rose linearly over the range of 9-80 x 10(6) nuclei/mL and was independent of the technique used for isolation. Nuclear fractions isolated using steroid-free solutions contained more estrogen receptor than estradiol; the numerical excess in control nuclei persisted in the nuclei of stimulated cells featuring a stoichiometric rise of ligand and receptor contents. The increase of receptor contents in nuclei isolated from hormone-stimulated cells coincided with a decline in the cytoplasmic fractions. An excess of hormone over receptor was seen only when nuclei were isolated from untreated cells with media containing 10 nM estradiol. Our data strengthen earlier notions of an estradiol-promoted receptor translocation into the nucleus and are not compatible with the ligand-filling hypothesis of preexisting nuclear binding sites."
"173","The proton-driven dissociation of oestradiol-receptor dimers as a preparative tool. Isolation of a 32 kDa fragment from porcine uteri and assignment of C-terminal origin by partial sequencing.","Thole, Jungblut, Jakob","1991","Homodimers of the porcine oestradiol receptor dissociated at pH 6.4. The monomers reassociate after neutralization. This property is retained in a 32 kDa receptor fragment generated by co-adsorbed endopeptidases from cytosolic receptor bound to heparin-Sepharose. The fragment was purified by successive gel filtrations in the dimer and monomer states. Precipitations with ethanol and (NH4)2SO4 respectively served as concentrating steps. In all, 10-15 nmol of the homogeneous fragment were recovered from 8 kg batches of porcine uteri with a approximately 10(5)-fold enrichment and in approximately 20% yields. Its oestradiol-binding capacity was identical with that of the intact receptor. The N-terminus was blocked. Two decapeptides from a tryptic digest were sequenced. One of them corresponded to amino acids 353-362 of the human receptor, a sequence fully conserved in all species investigated. The second peptide differed in positions 553, 554 and 557 from the 549-558 sequence of the human protein."

The Mariensee model].","Jungblut, Sierralta, Henning, Kallweit","1991","The technique and the equipment necessary for the transcervical intrauterine injection in trained, ovariectomized pigs is detailed. Experimental groups of 14-16 week-old animals are recruited from German landrace litters with large numbers (4-9) of females. A silastic tubing containing a crystalline suspension of estradiol in propylene glycol is subcutaneously implanted behind the right ear. Ovariectomy and the detachment of the left uterine horn from the cervix are performed 7-10 days later. The animals are then kept for 6-7 weeks in ventilated stables, heated to 20 degrees C in wintertime, with 12 hr light dark cycle, free access to water and semi-ad libitum supplies of pelleted standard feed. The silastic implant gives rise to plasma levels of 8-12 pg estradiol/ml and still contains crystalline sediments when removed before the experiment. The manipulations for the transcervical, intrauterine instillation of solutions, imitating the reproductive action of the boar, are practiced daily for at least one week. The animals learn quickly to enter a restraining box, which is facilitated by the simultaneous offering of pellets drenched with root beer. The intrauterine injections proceed thereafter without any signs of stress from the animals. Stress is also avoided during slaughter by unexpected electric stunning on leaving the box, followed by exsanguination. Uteri are quickly excised and chilled in crushed ice until processed. One to two grams of endometrium cells can be harvested by curettage from each, treated and untreated (detached) horn. The Mariensee model allows for defined kinetic analyses of treated cells and provides nontreated controls from the same animal. It combines the advantages of in-vivo and in-vitro experiments."
"175","Blotting efficiency investigated by using two-dimensional electrophoresis, hydrophobic membranes and proteins from different sources.","Jungblut, Eckerskorn, Lottspeich, Klose","1990","Purification and chemical characterization of proteins may be achieved by combining two-dimensional electrophoresis (2-DE) and microsequencing or amino acid analysis. To enable this combination, the protein has to be transferred as completely as possible from the gel into the sequencer. In this study hydrophobic membranes were used as support for the transfer and proteins were transferred from the gels onto the membranes by semidry blotting. Blotting conditions were optimized to obtain high blotting efficiencies for as many proteins of a complex 2-DE pattern as possible. Under optimized conditions, blotting efficiencies between 60% and 100% were obtained for five marker proteins; the mean values from four regions of a 2-DE pattern from 29 unknown proteins of a complex protein mixture from mouse brain were between 60% and 79%. The four commercially available hydrophobic membranes that were compared showed only slight differences in protein amount on the membranes after blotting for whole protein patterns, whereas single proteins occurred with higher amounts on either one or the other membrane. The results of the blotting optimization allowed us to suggest a blotting mechanism with which systematic improvement of the blotting conditions is possible for problematic proteins."
"176","Analysis by high-resolution two-dimensional electrophoresis of differentiation-dependent alterations in cytosolic protein pattern of HL-60 leukemic cells.","Jungblut, Seifert","1990","HL-60 leukemic cells were differentiated along the neutrophilic pathway with retinoic acid (RA) or along the monocytic pathway with 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25(OH)2D3). Using a high-resolution two-dimensional electrophoresis technique and subsequent silver staining, differentiation-dependent changes in cytosolic protein pattern of HL-60 cells were analysed and were compared with the cytosolic protein pattern of human neutrophils. The amount of 64 and 50 out of a total of 632 proteins studied was increased or decreased in RA- and 1,25(OH)2D3-differentiated HL-60 cells, respectively, in comparison to undifferentiated HL-60 cells. Thirty-three of these proteins were similarly altered in RA- and 1,25(OH)2D3-differentiated HL-60 cells. Twenty-two and 25 of the proteins altered in amount in RA- or 1,25(OH)2D3-differentiated HL-60 cells versus undifferentiated HL-60 cells were similarly altered in human neutrophils in comparison to undifferentiated HL-60 cells. Seven and 10 of the proteins altered in amount in RA- or 1,25(OH)2D3-differentiated HL-60 cells had specific equivalents in neutrophil cytosol. Our results show (i) that neutrophilic and monocytic differentiation is associated with decreases and increases in amount of cytosolic proteins; (ii) that both differentiation processes share a common set of alterations; and (iii) are associated with specific alterations in protein amount."
"177","Dye ligand chromatography and two-dimensional electrophoresis of complex protein extracts from mouse tissue.","Jungblut, Klose","1989","A complex protein fraction of mouse brain was subjected to dye ligand chromatography with various dye ligands. The proteins that were bound by the dye-gel matrix and also the non-binding proteins were separated by high-resolution two-dimensional electrophoresis. The protein patterns obtained were compared. The results show that a large number of different protein species bind to dye ligands and do not occur in the eluate. Red A was the most efficient dye in isolating an individual protein class from a complex tissue extract. Moreover, we found that many of the binding proteins did not cross-react among different types of dye ligands. Orange A and Blue B were the most unrelated dyes among those compared. Our investigation shows that dye ligand chromatography can be used as a means (among others employed previously) of fractionating and classifying the enormous number of different protein species in a mammalian tissue when combined with high-resolution two-dimensional electrophoresis."
"178","Assignment of estradiol-17 beta dehydrogenase and of estrone reductase to cytoplasmic structures of porcine endometrium cells.","Adamski, Sierralta, Jungblut","1989","Homogenates of porcine endometrium contain substantial activity for the dehydrogenation of estradiol-17 beta but little for estrone reduction. Both activities are associated with cytoplasmic structures. The dehydrogenase is characterized by a pH 7.7 optimum, Km 2.2 x 10(-7) mol/l for estradiol and Km 4.4 x 10(-5) mol/l for the cosubstrate NAD+. The corresponding figures for the reductase are pH 6.6, Km 1.1 x 10(-6) mol/l for estrone and Km 2.1 x 10(-5) mol/l for the cosubstrate NADPH. The (mitochondrial/lysosomal) 17,000 x g particulate fraction contains a 52-fold higher dehydrogenase than reductase activity. The (microsomal) 200,000 x g particulate fraction is only 16-fold richer in dehydrogenase. Isopycnic centrifugations of the two fractions in Percoll gradients reveal that estrone reductase and the coequilibrating marker enzyme cytochrome c reductase occur in constant proportions, whereas the dehydrogenase/cytochrome c reductase ratios are different. Both, the kinetic data and the structural assignments speak in favour of individual enzymes catalyzing the dehydrogenation of estradiol and the reduction of estrone. All gradient fractions exhibiting dehydrogenase activity feature small, electrodense vesicles of 0.15-0.20 microns in diameter as a common structural element which might harbour the dehydrogenase."

For the purpose of comparison, liver cytosol proteins were also investigated. The protein samples were prepared from two inbred strains of the mouse (DBA/2J, C57BL/6J) and their hybrids. The patterns obtained were compared with regard to the composition and genetic variability (qualitative and quantitative variants) of proteins from different nuclear fractions and organs. The percentage (greater than 30%) of spots common to different organs (liver, brain), but from the same nuclear fraction (plasma) was greater than the percentage (less than 20%) of spots common to different cell and nuclear fractions (cytosol, nuclear plasma and nuclear membranes) of the same organ (liver). Quantitative genetic variants occurred much more frequently than qualitative genetic variants (5.1% vs. 0.2%; liver nuclear plasma). The incidence of genetic variants was much higher in liver (5.3%) than in brains (0.0%), and higher in solubilized nuclear proteins (5.3%) than in structure-bound nuclear proteins (2.1%)."
"180","Differential expression of cytosolic activation factors for NADPH oxidase in HL-60 leukemic cells.","Seifert, Jungblut, Schultz","1989","Activation of NADPH oxidase in undifferentiated HL-60 leukemic cells and in HL-60 cells differentiated along the myeloid pathway with dibutyryl cyclic AMP (dbcAMP) or dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO) was studied. Upon stimulation with a calcium ionophore, a phorbol ester, arachidonic acid or gamma-hexachlorocyclohexane, Me2SO-differentiated HL-60 cells generated superoxide (O2-) at higher rates than dbcAMP-differentiated cells. Undifferentiated cells generated O2- only at low rates upon stimulation with the above agents. In cell-free systems, NADPH oxidase activity was reconstituted by combining membranes of undifferentiated or dbcAMP- or Me2SO-differentiated HL-60 cells, cytosol of Me2SO-differentiated cells and arachidonic acid. This basal O2- formation was enhanced several-fold by guanosine 5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) (GTP[gamma S]), a potent activator of guanine nucleotide-binding proteins. In contrast, cytosol of dbcAMP-differentiated cells reconstituted O2- formation only in the presence of GTP[gamma S], and cytosol of undifferentiated cells was inactive. Submaximally stimulatory amounts of cytosolic protein of Me2SO- and dbcAMP-differentiated cells synergistically stimulated O2- formation in the presence but not in the absence of GTP[gamma S]. We conclude that differentiations of HL-60 cells with Me2SO and dbcAMP are not equivalent with respect to activation of NADPH oxidase and that two cytosolic activation factors are involved in the regulation of this effector system."

This method avoids the drawbacks of classical purification and isolation methods which involve time-consuming operations with low resolution and, often, insufficient yields. Excellent overall yields of minor amounts (in the low microgram range) using this method allow for sequence determination of yet inaccessible proteins. Solubilized cell proteins of mouse brain were separated by high resolution two-dimensional electrophoresis and electroblotted onto a siliconized glass fiber membrane. The immobilized proteins were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250, and twelve proteins spots were then submitted to both Edman degradation and amino acid analysis. Proteins were identified by comparison of the experimentally determined amino acid composition with a dataset derived from the Protein Identification Resource (PIR) protein sequence database.

Patterns with varying proportions between high and low density peaks are observed, when aliquots of a tissue sample are processed with different all-glass Potter-Elvejhem homogenizers. The described constant-tolerance shearing device (CTSD), in contrast, provides homogenate fractions with higher latencies and steady distribution patterns. They are characteristic for each of the six lysosomal markers and the six other structure-bound enzymes measured in gradient fractions of the particulate matter harvested between 600g and 17,000g. The 17,000g sediments of CTSD homogenates contain more than 40% of the total lysosomal enzymatic activities. Recoveries from Percoll gradients are between 93 and 101%. Enrichments in the high density region range from 35-fold (beta-glucosidase) to 82-fold (acid ribonuclease). Both lysosomal populations exhibit latencies between 89 and 94%. Our results indicate that light lysosomes can be artificially generated by inappropriate homogenization, which should be considered in experiments on the formation and maturation of lysosomes."
"183","Biosynthesis and posttranslational finishing of the estradiol receptor.","Sierralta, Szendro, Kallweit, Jungblut","1987","The time course of subcellular receptor distribution in porcine endometrial epithelium was studied after intrauterine administration of estradiol alone or in combination with puromycin. In untreated cells, the major proportion of receptor is associated with cytoplasmic membranes. The solubilization of receptor from isolated nuclei is independent of their estradiol content. Smooth cytoplasmic membranes are the site of origin of receptor which is swiftly translocated into the nucleus in a 1:1 ratio with the hormone after exposure of the cells to estradiol. Simultaneously administered puromycin delays receptor synthesis and reveals that the nuclear passage of receptor is terminated by receptor degradation. The synthesis of receptor proceeds in rough endoplasmic membranes. A subsequent finishing and deposition in smooth membranes depends on intact protein synthesis."

The H-S binding and nonbinding proteins were separated by two-dimensional electrophoresis. The protein patterns obtained were analyzed with regard to their protein composition and their genetic variability (qualitative and quantitative variants). Eighty to ninety percent of the H-S binding proteins were unique to this class of proteins. This class was rich in organ-specific proteins. Compared to the nonbinding proteins the portion of basic proteins was only slightly increased, suggesting that most of the H-S binding proteins interact specifically with heparin. The frequency of qualitative protein variants revealed that H-S binding proteins are more conservative than H-S nonbinding proteins. The quantitative genetic variability was higher in liver than in brain. Quantitative protein variants occurred more frequently than qualitative variants."
"185","Isolation and purification of cyanogen bromide-derived peptides of type II collagen directly from tissue (Swarm chondrosarcoma).","Kittelberger, Jungblut, Barrach","1986","A preparative procedure is described for isolating type II collagen-fragments directly from tissue. Swarm chondrosarcoma from rat, a cartilagenous tissue rich in type II collagen, was digested by cyanogen bromide in 70% formic acid. The resulting crude extract was desalted (G 25 column chromatography) and lyophylized. The yield of peptide mixture was about 1 250 mg obtained from 100 g tissue. The method of purification commonly used for type II collagen prior to cyanogen bromide-cleavage yielded 20 mg peptides from 100 g tissue. Separation of the cyanogen bromide-derived fragments was performed by gel filtration. The column was run at 43 degrees C (denaturing-temperature of collagens) to avoid fibril formation, and a volatile buffer was used (ammonium formate buffer, pH 7.5) so that the effluent fractions could be easily lyophylized. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis of the main peaks of the column profile demonstrated that this purification step resulted in a good separation of the fragment mixture, although additional steps may be necessary for complete separation of the peptides. The most striking advantages of the method for direct digestion of tissue outlined here are the increase in yield (about 60-fold) and the reduction of purification steps (avoiding type II collagen purification)."
"186","Genetic variability of proteins from mitochondria and mitochondrial fractions of mouse organs.","Jungblut, Klose","1985","Proteins of whole mitochondria from mouse liver and brain and proteins of liver mitochondrial fractions (plasma and rough membrane fraction) were separated by two-dimensional electrophoresis. Protein patterns of two inbred strains of mouse, C57BL/6J and DBA/2J, and of F1 mice of these two strains were studied. The protein patterns obtained from the different mitochondrial materials were analyzed with regard to their protein composition and the genetic variability of proteins (qualitative and quantitative protein variants). Included in this analysis are data previously obtained from the cytosols and plasma membranes of the same organs and mouse strains. The results showed the following. Mitochondria and organelle-free cell components (cytosol and plasma membranes) have only a few percent of their proteins in common, while two organs, liver and brain, reveal up to approximately 50% organ-nonspecific proteins. The frequency of proteins common to solubilized and structure-bound proteins ranges below 20%. Genetic variability in protein amount occurs much more frequently than genetic variability in protein structure. Liver proteins reveal more genetic variants than brain proteins. Proteins solubilized in the cell show more genetic variation than structure-bound proteins. Furthermore, the results show that with regard to the composition and the genetic variability of proteins, liver and brain differ more in their mitochondria than in their cytosol and plasma membranes."

Better yields (approximately 50%) of both forms are obtained in the presence of Surfynol 485. Dithiothreitol boosts the solubilization of basic receptor. Together, Surfynol and dithiothreitol have a more than additive effect, amounting to 3-4 times the quantities of receptor extracted with plain buffer. Trypsin more than triples the yields obtained with Surfynol/dithiothreitol, while degrading both receptor forms to a characteristic fragment. Hyaluronoglucosaminidase is somewhat less effective than trypsin. It changes acidic receptor to basic. The proportions of acidic/basic receptor in microsomal subfractions are different. Rough endoplasmic reticulum contains almost exclusively basic receptor. Smooth membranes are rich in acidic receptor. The efficacy of both enzymes is closely related to the proportion of acidic receptor found in Surfynol/dithiothreitol extracts."

Subfractionation of microsomes reveals a preponderance of ""basic"" (low electrophoretic mobility) receptor in rough endoplasmic reticulum. Surfynol-dithiothreitol extracts of smooth membranes are rich in ""acidic"" (high electrophoretic mobility) receptor. Trypsin increases the yields up to seven-fold, and this increase is correlated (r = 0.993) with the acidic receptor content and 5'-nucleotidase activity of these microsomal preparations. Acidic microsomal ""cytosolic"" and nuclear receptor can be degraded to the ""basic"" variety of streptomyces hyaluronidase. All forms give rise to a tryptic fragment with unchanged affinity for oestradiol and dimerization ability. Basic receptor isolated after enzymatic conversion of acidic receptor is microheterogenous on isoelectric focusing, but gives rise to only one precipitation arc versus the IgG fraction of a polyclonal antiserum. The precipitation arc can be recharged with labelled oestradiol and autoradiographed. Non-immune IgG's from (unspecific) soluble complexes with oestrogen receptors, but not with their tryptic fragments. The polyclonal antioestrogen receptor IgG fraction precipitates the oestradiol-tagged tryptic receptor fragment from all subcellular sources of all homologous (porcine) and heterologous (human, ovine, bovine, goat, rabbit, guinea pig, rat) target tissues tested. Organ specificity can therefore be excluded and a high degree of phylogenetic conservation of the oestrogen receptor's protein moiety is implied. The presence, in the immune IgG fraction, of steroid releasing antibodies, which apparently distort the binding site, should spur the search for monoclonal antibodies with similar properties."
"190","2. Mechanism of steroid action. Immunoreactivity of the core of estrogen receptors found in different subcellular compartments of target cells from a variety of mammalian species.","Jungblut, Hekim, Meyer, Szendro","1983","A goat antiserum was raised by immunization with the endoglycosidase fission product of porcine estrogen receptor. Its IgG fraction was employed for ascertaining the interrelationship of receptor forms extracted from three subcellular compartments of target cells and for comparing receptors from various species. Unspecific alignments of (non-immune) IgGs giving rise to soluble complexes were avoided by removal of the receptor entity responsible with carrier-attached trypsin. Coincubation of the estradiol-tagged tryptic receptor cores and immune IgG resulted in the formation of labelled precipitates and in the release of estradiol from its binding site, in every instance tested. A minimum of three common antigenic determinants must therefore exist not only on all porcine receptor forms, but also on human, ovine, bovine, rabbit, guinea-pig and rat estrogen receptors, pointing to a high degree of phylogenetic conservation."
"191","Purification of the steroid-binding core of porcine estrogen receptor.","Meyer, Jungblut","1983","The steroid-binding core of estradiol receptor was purified from pig uterus cytosol by a protocol consisting of (1) adsorption to heparin-sepharose, (2) enzymatic release of the receptor core, (3) DEAE-chromatography, (4) Sephadex G-150 filtration and (5) chromatography on heparin-sepharose. The final product was approximately 18000-fold enriched over the starting material. It consisted of at least 18% core protein resembling dimeric microsomal receptor with a molecular mass of 75 kDa and an isoelectric point of 5.8 (microheterogeneity). A goat antiserum raised against the preparation contains immunoglobulins G precipitating estradiol-receptor complexes, and antibodies releasing the steroid from its binding site."
"192","Validation of the common-core hypothesis of estrogen receptors with precipitating and steroid-releasing antibodies.","Hekim, Meyer, Szendro, Jungblut","1983","The immunoglobulin G fraction of a goat antiserum raised against a presumed endoglycosidase-fission product of estradiol receptor from porcine uteri contains some antibodies which precipitate the estradiol/receptor complex and others which release the steroid from the protein. Subcellular receptor forms and receptors from different porcine target organs react in the same fashion as do human, ovine, bovine, guinea pig, rabbit and rat estradiol receptors."
"193","Unspecific interactions of estrogen receptors with immunoglobulins and their absence in the tryptic receptor fragment.","Hekim, Jungblut","1983","Immunoglobulin G preparations align unspecifically with all naturally occurring forms of the estradiol receptor, giving rise to soluble complexes of moderately increased sedimentation velocities. This interaction is not shown by the tryptic receptor fragment, which still contains the high affinity steroid binding site and the dimerization links of the native receptor."
"194","A non-surgical technique for the transcervical administration of physiological and pharmacological agents into rat uteri.","Chwalisz, Zou, Jungblut","1983","A technique for the instillation of solutions into the rat uterine lumen is described. The method has been tested by following the receptor depletion/replenishment cycle after oestradiol injection and by checking on the stoichiometry of hormone/receptor translocation from the cytoplasmic compartment into the nucleus. Both crude sediments from frozen uteri and nuclei purified by a novel procedure were analyzed and gave identical results. The limitations and the advantages of the technique are discussed."

"196","quality control in steroid hormone receptor analyses.","Wagner, Jungblut","1980","In this paper, standards for steroid hormone receptor determinations in cancer tissue have been outlined. Standardization of methods for receptor extraction and receptor assay are equally important; and it is a condition sine qua non, if comparable receptor values between different centers for multilocal studies are required. Immediate and proper cooling of the tissue samples after removal, homogenization at the temperatures of the liquid nitrogen (as well as the presence of a sulfhydryl-protecting agent in the extraction medium), and the use of a simple, reproducible assay procedure are most important. As a standard procedure for ER- and PR-assays, the charcoal adsorption method combined with a scatchard-plot has been suggested. Reference procedures, like protein with DNA-assays, must also be standardized. Quality control experiments can be performed with lyophylized calf uterus homogenates. Additional determination of the nuclear estradiol in the high-speed sediments by radioimmunoassay is highly recommended."
"197","Studies on the involvement of lysosomes in estrogen action, III. The dehydrogenation of estradiol to estrone by porcine endometrial lysosomes.","Entenmann, Sierralta, Jungblut","1980","Endometrial cells from prepuberal pigs contain an estradiol 17 beta-dehydrogenase. By differential centrifugation of homogenate fractions and isopycnic separation of the particles sedimenting in the 600 leads to 38000 x g range, accompanied by marker enzyme and electron microscopic analyses, the enzyme appears to be exclusively associated with a subpopulation of lysosomes. It displays a high affinity for estradiol with a Km = 5 x 10(-7) mol/l. Dehydrogenation of estradiol to estrone is favorably driven by NAD, poorly by NADP. The reverse reaction with estrone as substrate and either NADH or NADPH or NADPH + regenerating system as cosubstrate does not proceed beyond the detection level, but trace amounts of 6 alpha/7 alpha-hydroxyestrone are observed at pH 6.5 with the latter two cosubstrates."

"199","Studies on the involvement of lysosomes in estrogen action, II. Seasonal variation in the sedimentation patterns of endometrial lysosomes from prepuberal pigs.","Entenmann, Parl, Jungblut","1979","The lysosomal population in endometrial cells of prepuberal pigs varies with the seasons. In summertime, lysosomes equilibrate in sucrose density gradients over a broad, domeshaped area from p = 1.21 g/cm3 to p = 1.15 g/cm3. The winter pattern is characterized by a major sharp peak of aggregated lysosomes at p = 1.20 g/cm3, visible as a ""snowflurry""-like band. The two extremes are linked by transition patterns in spring and fall. The possible correlation of this phenomenon to the seasonal fluctuations in the level of soluble cytoplasmic estrogen receptor is discussed."

"201","The occurrence of steroid-free, ""activated"" estrogen receptor in target cell nuclei.","Jungblut, Kallweit, Sierralta, Truitt, Wagner","1978","New techniques for the adrenalectomy of pigs and for the isolation of pig uterus nuclei are described. The isolated nuclei were analysed for their content of estradiol and of estradiol receptor. The concentration of the latter exceeded that of the hormone in extracts of uterine nuclei from ovariectomized pigs by ratios of 1.8--10.3. Substantial amounts of both monomer and ""activated"" dimer receptor but no estradiol at all were extracted from uterine nuclei of ovariectomized/adrenalectomized pigs. The mechanism of action of steroid hormones is discussed on the basis of these results."
"202","Studies on the involvement of lysosomes in estrogen action, I. Isolation and enzymatic properties of pig endometrial lysosomes.","Sierralta, Truitt, Jungblut","1978","Pig endometrium cells, collected by curettage and homogenized in an all-glass Potter Elvehjem homogenizer, gave a considerably higher yield of intact mitochondria and lysosomes than homogenates of whole uterus obtained with the Ultraturrax or the Parr bomb. After homogenization of the cells and subfractionation in the presence of Mg2, mitochondria and lysosomes equilibrated at the same modal density in isopycnic centrifugation. Homogenization and subfractionation in buffers devoid of divalent cations and containing EDTA resulted in a decrease in the buoyant density of mitochondria, allowing for a separation from lysosomes. The pH optima and the specific activities of two mitochondrial enzymes and eight hydrolyases used as marker enzymes were determined. The morphological characteristics of fractions were established by electron microscopy. Preliminary results indicate an involvement of lysosomes in steroid metabolism rather than in steroid and receptor translocation into the nucleus."

"205","Ovarian-independent fluctuations of estradiol receptor levels in mammalian tissues.","Hughes, Jacobson, Wagner, Jungblut","1976","Three types of periodic fluctuation in tissue concentrations of estradiol receptor protein have been observed. A seasonal variation is described in the uteri of 12-16-week-old calves and of ovariectomized pigs, and in mammary tumor tissue obtained from postmenopausal women. A circadian rhythm has been demonstrated in uteri of ovariectomized rats. An irregular periodic fluctuation has been found in uteri of ovariectomized and of ovariectomized/hypophysectomized rats, with the period varying from 9 to 15 days. These observations establish that a substantial turnover of receptor occurs in the absence of hormone and that 'normal' baseline values of receptor concentration do not exist."
"206","Oestradiol- and dihydrotestosterone receptors in normal and neoplastic human mammary tissue.","Wagner, Jungblut","1976","Human mammary gland and tumours derived from it contain individual receptors for oestradiol) and for dihydrotestosterone. Analysis of 97 mammary cancers by agargel electrophoresis revealed a widely varying pattern of simultaneous occurrence in different concentration ratios (46), sole presence of oestradiol receptor (23) or dihydrotestosterone receptor (8) and absence of both receptors (18). The relevance of the results is discussed and the need for an extensive cooperative study is emphasized."

With this method, the presence of progesterone receptor has been demonstrated in heavily plasma-protein-contaminated human uterus ""cytosol"", but not in human mammary carcinoma extracts. SHBG and ""basic"" receptors for estradiol and dihydrotestosterone in human uterus cytosol could also be assayed simultaneously."

The two radioactive estradiol-receptor complexes, observed in uterine homogenates in the supernatant fraction and in an extract of the nuclear fraction, respectively, are disrupted by brief exposure to organic mercurials in the cold. Sulfhydryl groups of uterine receptor substances apparently play a vital role in estradiol binding, perhaps indirectly through contribution to receptor conformation."
